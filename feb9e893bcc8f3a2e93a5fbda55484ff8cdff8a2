      "message": "Note that the default perf timeline uses \"TPS.\" as prefix. And we were using \"Power.\" prefix when collecting power in a different perf time line before this CL.\n\nPower metrics are named after relevant sysfs path names. Example names are \"B0D4\", \"cpu\" etc. They recorded under \"Power.B0D4\", \"Power.cpu\" before. With this CL, they would be \"TPS.B0D4\" and \"TPS.cpu\". It would be confusing to look at, IMHO.\n\nIs there a way to keep \"Power.\" prefix?",
