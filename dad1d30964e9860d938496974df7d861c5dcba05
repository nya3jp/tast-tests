(I don\u0027t really understand why you\u0027re making up new error reasons and demoting the existing error reasons to log messages here? Is there a character restriction on how long an error reason can be in tast? In general, I think it\u0027s better if the error reason already explains the problem accurately and people aren\u0027t forced to dig through the logs to understand what they did wrong.)",
