However, I cannot repro the failure yet.\n\nI\u0027m ok to temporarily disable this once to double check if this is really the cause on the bot or not, for the short term, just to focus on unblock LKGM uprev.\nIf it does not fix, pls reland this sooner than later. We\u0027re relying this test to make sure lacros is not broken.\n\nNote that there\u0027re currently no theory we see this is culprit / no proof. So it looks like just a random trial, right?\nDefer to Eliot for the decision.",
