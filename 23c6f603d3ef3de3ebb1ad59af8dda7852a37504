I think this is due to the example.pass test being so quick that profiler is being stopped too quickly after starting since other tests I tried didn\u0027t require this sleep to copy the file successfully. \n\nNot sure if there would be a better way to do this or if it would be okay to leave this as is since it\u0027s just 400 Ms (which was the minimum time I could do and still succeed in example.Pass).",
