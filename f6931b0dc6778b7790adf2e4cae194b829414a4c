      "message": "That\u0027s a good point. WDYT about the following plan:\n\n1.Disable DCHECK on all standardized input tests (this CL)\n2.a Continue converting standardized input tests to \u0027critical\u0027 \n2.b Set up a test that handles the general DCHECK case and get it to \u0027critical\u0027\n3. After a few iterations of 2.b to clean up bugs, I go back and re-enable DCHECK on the standardized input tests\n\nMy goal is to continue converting input tests to critical while I iron out the DCHECK issue. With the plan above, we could continue doing both, and still converge to a spot where these checks are re-enabled.",
