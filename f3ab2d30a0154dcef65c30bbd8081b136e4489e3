The only reason why we need ARC to run this test is to get the recording parameter from media_profiles.xml, which should be same for ARC++ and ARCVM.\n\n+hywu@, the author of HAL3 test binary, WDYT?",

That\u0027s the reason we need to enable extra \"vm\" parameter here even though they mostly does not have interaction with the Android side.\n\nBut actually, there are 2 tests that require android-sh (which depends on Android being booted in ARCVM): the hal3_module and hal3_recording, so they also need different Pre for ARCVM.",
