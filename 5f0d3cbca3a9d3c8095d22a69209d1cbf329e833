Maybe checking in perfutil.StoreLatency might be a choice.\n- or, I guess it\u0027s even nicer to change in ash/public/cpp/presentation_time_recorder.cc in chromium repository to not produce metrics.\n\nDo you know why it fails?  Is it a problem of the certain board?\nIf the board is known to be problematic right now, can we also add a hwdep to exclude that?",

But it would probably be good for the test to fail in case other boards have the same problem.\n\nupstream kernel patch: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/386167/?series\u003d80751\u0026rev\u003d1",
