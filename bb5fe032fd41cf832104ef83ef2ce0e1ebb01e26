      "message": "Unclear how to expose the real error that happens during enrollment.\n\nWhen I have the code like this it passes but that\u0027s not how it should be done because it doesn\u0027t check for any specific error. If I modify the test to \"err !\u003d nil\" to actually expose the error, it\u0027s just a standard \"failed to start chrome\". I tried searching the logs for the strings that appear in the image below I don\u0027t find anything. Any idea how to actually check that this enrollment error appeared on screen?\n\nThe error that I\u0027m seeing on screen: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/6nmqnsFMh4eEUF8.png",
