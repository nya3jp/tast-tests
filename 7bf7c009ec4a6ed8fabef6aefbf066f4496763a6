Back then it was an acceptable way forward. I am not sure about the decision process here. There are two options going forward:\n1) if all good, accept the change as is\n2) if not, introduce a new type of tests, similar to existing `testFilesFix`, but with a configurable timeout option.",

      "message": "This CL triggered a conversation, whether we should run more tests on bullseye, as it is used by 2/3 of the customers. This led to creating a separate bug b/234390590 for that. We have also agreed that it is fine for the time being to merge this CL as is. It will remove bullseye test variant for `ResizeBackupRestore`. Later, this test will be migrated from buster to bullseye as a part of a separate effort (b/234390590).",
