The \"sync\" method is exported from Nearby service by the Dev team and mark it as for testing only. http://b/187867513\n\nWe can call \"sync\" directly inside the \"setupDevice\" RPC if you prefer to do in this way.\nhttp://google3/javatests/com/google/android/gmscore/integ/modules/nearby/mobly/snippets/sharing/SharingClientSnippet.java?l\u003d99\u0026rcl\u003d383759889",
