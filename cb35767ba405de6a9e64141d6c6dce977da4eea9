      "message": "From my understanding of this CL, it looks like RunPrintTest() will ignore/overwrite the PrinterName field if a caller populates it, but RunPrintJob() requires the field to be populated by the caller. So these two functions take the same struct type as a parameter, but have different opinions about what its members mean. Wouldn\u0027t it be cleaner to take PrinterName out of this struct and make the printer name a separate parameter to RunPrintJob?",
