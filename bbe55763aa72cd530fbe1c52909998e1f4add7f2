      "message": "I don\u0027t have concern about the code itself.\n\nAbout the testing logic: This only verifies that the target app can show up in Play Store, but not that this is because of the policy. This is because there\u0027s no test that verifies blocked app doesn\u0027t show up in Play Store. Theoretically, there could be another factor (always true when you run your test) that makes the target app shows up in Play Store.\n\nYes there\u0027s another test that verifies uninstallation of blocked app, but it\u0027s different.",

      "message": "IMO, it would be nice to verify allow and block near each other, with all factors/code the same except for the policy. That would make it clear that the policy is the only factor making the difference (app show up / not show up).\n\nIf \"block app\" is tested is another test/file, then there could be small/tricky difference between that and the \"allow app\" test. Such difference would be hard to see, and may grow over time (if/when we change only one of the two).\n\nAlternatively, we may also reuse code for allow/block/force-install situations, which would ensure that the only difference is the policy (ignore the difference in verification code).\n\nAnother thought is that, for the allow/block/force-install policy, ideally we test their state and also transition between states.\n\nWhat do you think?",
