      "message": "Agree. Made this more evident by splitting the condition+error, and also fixed that |during|\nshould not be zero (same in l.117), but different from |before|, IOW: the test should work\nfine with |before| being non-zero, but then |during| (the amount of graphics buffers during\nthe test) should grow; otherwise the test would not be working as expected..",
