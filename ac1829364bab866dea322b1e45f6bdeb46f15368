      "message": "ah, i see that this is one of the tests that wanted to check board names. :-)\n\ndo you know the background of why we can\u0027t run the tests on these? i\u0027m assuming that rialto may not have audio hardware, in which case a USE flag seems like it may be appropriate. (do we run CRAS on rialto?)\n\nsee also https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/src/chromiumos/cmd/local_test_runner/main.go#33, where i\u0027m omitting chrome_login for rialto. one option would be to have audio_play and audio_record features and split this into two separate tests.\n\nwhat do you think?",
