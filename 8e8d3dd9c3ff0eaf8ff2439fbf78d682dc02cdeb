      "message": "Not really. I don\u0027t remember the rate at which we saw this in the lab before, and I also don\u0027t know if the small differences in how we filter with *shark vs. gopacket will catch things differently.\n\nChecking again, ACKs won\u0027t actually count here, because they don\u0027t have a TA field (they only use a single address, for the receiver). So I\u0027ll drop that.\n\nFor BlockAcks: it\u0027s possible still, but I don\u0027t know the rate.\n\nLocally, I haven\u0027t reproduced anything similar in quite a few runs on 2 or 3 different DUTs I have sitting around. But we always find \"rare\" combinations or firmware behaviors once running across hundreds of systems in the lab.\n\nBut yes, somebody would need to watch out for this when (re)stabilizing this test I think. If this lands ~soon-ish, I\u0027ll probably do that, or else hand the bug off to someone else.",
