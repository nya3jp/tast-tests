      "message": "The event to poll would be (a) stable PD contract on Port0 (DUTCHG) followed by (b) stable PD contract on Port1 (DUT).\n\nUnfortunately, there are state desync/timing errors in synchronization between the two ports. See bug. Servo passthrough code itself needs to be re-written from scratch as proper fix. Transition commands need to be blocking/callback (ideally). Then these delays would be unnecessary.\n\n\nI think we are moderately safe with these worst-case values (assuming desync, port HARD_RESET, renegotiation).",
