Other than the non-ipp enumeration test case, the ones that don\u0027t are more likely to be a mistake than an intentional omission.  What do you think about adding a WaitForScanner option and migrating these into the new Start() as well?",

Today, WaitUntilConfigured() uses a CUPS-specific backdoor to see if a printer is configured. We suspect it is better to watch the top of the print stack (i.e. await an ash notification).",
