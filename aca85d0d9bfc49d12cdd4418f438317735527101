It doesn\u0027t seem to be available to be imported in this directory (I tried several variations of \"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\" and \"gopkg.in/fsnotify.v0\"). How difficult would it be to add this package, or do you have any advice for an alternate way of doing this? I\u0027m currently working on a dbus solution.",
