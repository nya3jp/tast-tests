      "message": "I\u0027m not totally sure if it\u0027s a good idea allowing extra apps in the test. Every few months someone would add a new force-installed app to the root domain by accident. I expect this to happen more frequently as the managedchrome.com domain continues growing. This would further slow down the already slow installation process on many low-end devices, resulting in more failures due to timeout. Eventually we will still have to remove those apps from the domain.\n\n@pbond WDYT?",
