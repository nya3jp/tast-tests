      "message": "I don\u0027t think that this increase is completely necessary, especially not this large of an increase(100ms to 500ms), but I thought it would be better to be extreme here. Hopefully 500ms is enough for even really slow duts. Also, since 500ms delay is only for a few clicks, this shouldn\u0027t effect test execution time too much.\n\nAny suggestions for what the slowest dut is so that I can do some testing?",
