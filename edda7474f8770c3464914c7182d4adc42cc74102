      "message": "This is fixed, based on me trying some numbers that make the click land on the video area.\n\nIt\u0027s possible to find where the element is on the web-page but I think that\u0027s harder to translate to screen DP coordinates - e.g. may depend on website scroll, or the size of the tab strip.\n\nOne thing I considered was to take the coordinates offset from the bottom of the window to avoid the tabstrip, but it seemed relatively complicated for not that much payoff - considering this is a bug that we want to fix anyway.\n\nWDYT?",
