      "message": "Ran tests 20 times and observed issue of play store failed to close and test failing here. \n\nI tried replacing apps.Close with ash.GetARCAppWindowInfo and CloseWindow but that was flaky as well failing to find the window (Probably WaitForPlayStoreShown is not actually ensuring that Play Store window is completely Open).\nHence adding this close logic only when ash.WaitForAppClosed returned error. 20+ runs are stable with this.\n\nUpdated the comment with more details.",
