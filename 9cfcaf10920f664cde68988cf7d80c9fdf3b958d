      "message": "Using hwdep.FormFactor(hwdep.Detachable) would filter out the non-detachables. I was considering the case when a detachable has its base removed at start. \n\nThough I\u0027m not sure if such case would ever occur, with base removed, the script would fail in verifying that DUT\u0027s laptop mode status preserves over a reboot, which I think is an expected behavior by design. \n\nAdding hwdep.Touchpad() would block detachables without a base. We could probably add some extra lines of code to hwdep.Keyboard() for the same goal.",
