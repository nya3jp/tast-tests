How much was that?\nAlso, even if the existence of browser windows subtract the performance numbers, does that really matter?  The goal of this test was (IIRC) to compare the video performance with and without underlays for PiP.  If browser window affects the performance on both cases uniformly, it wouldn\u0027t matter.",
