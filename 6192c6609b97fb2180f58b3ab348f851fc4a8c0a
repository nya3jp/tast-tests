      "message": "As for skipping condition implementation, I think we don\u0027t want to depend of media from here. Also, it\u0027s better to check via software dependency. Could you write the check instead? You can refer https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/HEAD:src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/internal/setup/preflight.go;l\u003d46\n\nAlso, could you make this configurable by tests, and let callers set it?\nIn general, it is not a good idea to behave tests differently per board.\nI think this specific case makes sense, but it\u0027s better to make it reponsibility of callers, so that new users can be aware that this may behave differently on VM environment.",
