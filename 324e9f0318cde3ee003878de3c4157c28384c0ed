      "message": "This is a high risk change as it removes potentially all testing of Crostini independently of ARC++. \n\nParticularly as ARC++ moves to ARCVM there is a risk of introducing dependencies of Crostini on a running ARC that may break Crostini for users who do not have ARC enabled.\n\nWhile the code looks ok, this is a change that needs to be discussed with and signed off by the whole team.\n\nLets schedule a meeting, or discuss in standup next week.
