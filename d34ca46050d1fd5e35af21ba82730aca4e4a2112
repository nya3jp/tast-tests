      "message": "I saw your reply, but I don\u0027t think the suggested approach works. Software deps declare what use flags are necessary for the test to run. We\u0027re guaranteed by the tast framework that any use flags required by the software deps are present, but there\u0027s no supported mechanism for the test to determine anything further about the use flags.\n\nDo you have any other suggestions for a reliable way to determine at runtime whether or not we\u0027re running on a manatee board?",
