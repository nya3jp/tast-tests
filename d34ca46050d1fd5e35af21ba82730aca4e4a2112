      "message": "As I understand it, the tast SoftwareDeps are a property of the tests, not a property of the device. The tast infrastructure checks a test\u0027s SoftwareDeps against the device\u0027s use flags to make sure the test is running in the correct environment. However, as far as I know, there isn\u0027t a way for test code to query the device\u0027s use flags at runtime.\n\nThere is a function to get the SoftwareDeps from a context, but that was added to allow fixtures to ensure that their dependencies are available (i.e. ARC fixtures use it to check that tests properly declare an ARC SoftwareDep).",
