      "message": "I didn\u0027t extract these out into a common file since they are so small. I did it for some other components though which were more complex and clearly the same. It\u0027s probably worth taking another look at everything after we are fully done with this to see how we can refactor the legacy and openwrt router implementations to only include what is platform specific, and have everything else in common.",
