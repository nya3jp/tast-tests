Something like \"failure.txt\" would be fine. or command_output.txt\n\nYou can just use str as the name of the string here.\n\nWhy are you declaring a function like this inline? I\u0027d expect to just see a top level function like \nfunc LogFailure(s string) error {\n  ...write to the file, return error on failure.\n}",
