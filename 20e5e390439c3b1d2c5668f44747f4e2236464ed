      "message": "Might be wise to log this? And maybe the disabling too. Eventually, tweaking the power-save settings should become the exception, rather than the norm, and it would also be important to know if (for instance) we still don\u0027t manage to finish resetting power-save for the next test.\n\nOr I wonder if we should be explicit in Tast, and always set power-save\u003don at the start of tests. But then that potentially gives the opposite problem of https://crbug.com/728769 -- if power-save policies change in the future, we might need to flip that back around. So maybe we don\u0027t want to do that for now.",

      "message": "It is nice to leave log for both SetPowersaveMode. Done.\n\nFor the powersave\u003don, as hard-coding any state can be a problem when policy changes, I also prefer keeping the default and have the tests restoring it for now. May re-consider this if we find that more tests really need to disable/restore and much increase the probability of leaving bad settings to later tests.",
