And in fact, I think this case would be pretty broken -- if shill is stopped while we log in, we\u0027ll fail to push the user profile, and the resulting state will be a borked login, where the user\u0027s profile data is not available.\n\nYou didn\u0027t cause that in this CL, but after you delete all the artificial setup and replace it with a real Chrome login, that becomes even clearer.",
