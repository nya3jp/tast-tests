      "message": "It would be kind of hard to do that because:\n- Each element of the array corresponds to a different key, and each of those keys are created differently, so an array on the creation side is difficult.\n- C0B1%02X series of elements are generated on the fly according to the other keys, and it would be hard to have an array for them on the creation side without breaking the relationship with the other keys.",

      "message": "I feel like this could lead to mistakes and data mismatches.\n\nI think it may be better to just move this list to a global location and then reference it in both places. Also, you can just define the first half of the list and then generate the second half of the list in each function.\n\nOtherwise, if you are going to build list here, I would build it out of constants. ex:\nkeyIDs :\u003d []string{importedKeyID, softwareKeyID, generatedKeyID}\n\nthen in the create function directly use the constants. I would still advise generating the second half of the list in this function.",
