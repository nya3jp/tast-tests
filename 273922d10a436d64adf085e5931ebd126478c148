It should be at least better than now.\n\nThough, \"wait for a certain period and check if something happens or not\" is a common flakiness pattern, so I\u0027d recommend to come up with some alternative conditions that we can explicitly wait for, in near future.\nE.g., add some marker / logs if there\u0027s no more secondary accounts, and let Tast wait for it.",
