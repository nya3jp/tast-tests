      "message": "Turns out I totally messed up how I was timing things, but this CL still seems to greatly reduce the flakiness of arc.Drivefs(maybe fixes it, but I am only running it locally on eve). The first call to click seems to have a long tail, but this overall is definitely lower latency. Still gonna submit it.\n\nalso, my mistake with timing:\n\tstart :\u003d time.Now()\n\tdefer testing.ContextLog(ctx, \"Click Time: \", time.Since(start))\n\nInstead of:\n\tstart :\u003d time.Now()\n\tdefer func() {\n\t\ttesting.ContextLog(ctx, \"Click Time: \", time.Since(start))\n\t}()",
