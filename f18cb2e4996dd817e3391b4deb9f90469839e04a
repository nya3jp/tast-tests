      "message": "Turns out I totally messed up how I was timing things, but this CL still seems to greatly reduce the flakiness of arc.Drivefs(maybe fixes it, but I am only running it locally on eve). The first call to click seems to have a long tail, but this overall is definitely lower latency. Still gonna submit it.\n\nalso, my mistake with timing:\n\tstart :\u003d time.Now()\n\tdefer testing.ContextLog(ctx, \"Click Time: \", time.Since(start))\n\nInstead of:\n\tstart :\u003d time.Now()\n\tdefer func() {\n\t\ttesting.ContextLog(ctx, \"Click Time: \", time.Since(start))\n\t}()",

      "message": "Another potential reduction of latency can be experimented by folding these 2 APIs (mouseMove and mouseClick) to be 1 API so we would avoid the API round-trip + the promise round trip.\n\nSo the code here would be something like:\n  await tast.promisify(chrome.autotestPrivate.mouseMoveAndClick(centerpoint, 0, button);\n\nBut, I expect that greater source of flakiness is the latency between calculating the coordinate and the actual click.\n\nI\u0027m focusing on this \"promise round-trip\" because I understand that this chrome.autotestPrivate runs in the same Browser process that Files app, does it run in the same render process too? I\u0027m thinking if the tast.promisify() and the Files app share the same JS event-loop, if they do share the same event-loop, every promising enqueued here gives more chances for Files app code to run and move things around because promises run after any potential event/callback from browser APIs. [1]  If tast.promisify() and Files app don\u0027t share the same event-loop, then the impact of these 2 promises are expect to be less relevant.\n\nAll that said, these are nothing to stop this CL but to explore for follow up CLs.\n\n[1] - https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules/",
