      "message": "Sounds great. Since LSS is a ChromeOS service, this is much easier.\n\n1. First option (Preferred): If we know the new expectation after the cl land. We can update the test data in the same cl or make them merge together. https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/contributing.md#cq-depend\n\n2. Second option: Change the test first to temporarily accept either A or B result. Then remove A after cl lands.\n\n3. If the search result is no longer deterministic. Then this test needs to be refactored / reconsidered. Please demote this test to informational level to unblock CL landing. The side effect is that we will lose test coverage.",

      "message": "Thanks for the advice, Jun.\n\nBased on the test failure in https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chrome/builders/ci/chromeos-betty-pi-arc-chrome/17515/test-results I think it failed because the search query \"helpa\" stopped matching anything due to the LSS change. This is a bit strange because last time we made sure to check that \"helpa\" does show results. But I didn\u0027t check it this time.\nAnother possible reason is this test is just bad (not deterministic).\n\nTo unblock the LSS change I think we could do both 2 and 3: Make the test informational. And also change the query from \"helpa\" to just \"help\" to make the matching even more lenient. This Tast test should just be testing that the full integration works. It doesn\u0027t need to test that fuzzy or prefix matching works.",
