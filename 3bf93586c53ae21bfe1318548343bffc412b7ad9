      "message": "hmm, i\u0027m not sure of the right way to do something like this. i don\u0027t think we want to log each of them, as it\u0027s likely to be spammy when a process disappears while we\u0027re reading its information.\n\nseveral other approaches i considered:\n\n- return a slice of errors instead of a single error. this just pushes the issue to the caller, though -- i\u0027m not sure what to do with multiple errors there.\n- accumulate error strings here and return them as a single comma-joined error. this loses the wrapped error information, though.\n\ni\u0027ll send this to the CQ as-is, but please let me know if you have suggestions that i can apply in a follow-up change.",
