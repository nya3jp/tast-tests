      "message": "Hi Hiroki,\n\nThis looks good to me, although there is one issue: the speech monitor is likely flaky. We had to disable the ChromeVox tast tests a while ago and I still haven\u0027t had the chance to fix them. Are you getting any unexpected test failures when testing locally?\n\nI will try to investigate the issue this week, but I also do not want to block your change.",

      "message": "Thanks for bringing up the concern.\n\nActually I tested both arc.AccessibilitySpeech and a11y.SpokenFeedback.google_tts multiple times with additional patches crrev/c/2918674 and crrev/c/2914953, and apparently the flakiness I observed was only in non-ARC tests:\n- expected utterances: [\"ChromeVox Options\"], but got: [\"tab created\"]\n\nAlso, having more data point that uses SpeechMonitor would be helpful for us to investigate its flakiness. It\u0027s fine to me for our test to become flaky due to this because I believe this is the right direction rather than each of us having different code for the same purpose. After this migration, both of us can contribute to SpeechMonitor or related classes.",
