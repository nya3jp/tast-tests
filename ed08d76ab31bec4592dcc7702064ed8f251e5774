I\u0027ve already added some comments, but we need a code owner to review. \n\nI\u0027m adding you because I saw you recently reviewed another typec tast update from Intel here (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3832060). But if you think there is someone else who should take a look, please let me know.\n\nThanks,\nJameson",
