      "message": "Even for the previous version, I don\u0027t know how long it is enough.\n\nMy understanding is that the previous version was working because animation durations (wait time) for maximize+restore was long enough. I don\u0027t think the operation is important given that waiting normal state was not working. If an operation itself is doing the job, I think it should be enough to just wait normal state.\n\nWe don\u0027t know how long it is enough in both ways. But if our intent is to just wait, I think `testing.Sleep` is better as the intention is clear (especially for future readers of this source code).",

Both Ash and Arc are managing their own WM states. For this case, if we open an Android app and a Chrome browser quickly, Arc gets out of WM state sync and ends up in the following state:\n\nWindow order:\nAsh: Chrome browser is front. Android app is back.\nArc: Android app is front. Chrome browser is back.\n\nWe need a sleep between Android app launch and Chrome browser launch.\n\ntakise@: Correct me if it\u0027s not the case.",
