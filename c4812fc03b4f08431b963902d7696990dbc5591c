      "message": "Even for the previous version, I don\u0027t know how long it is enough.\n\nMy understanding is that the previous version was working because animation durations (wait time) for maximize+restore was long enough. I don\u0027t think the operation is important given that waiting normal state was not working. If an operation itself is doing the job, I think it should be enough to just wait normal state.\n\nWe don\u0027t know how long it is enough in both ways. But if our intent is to just wait, I think `testing.Sleep` is better as the intention is clear (especially for future readers of this source code).",
