This is because it was explicitly broken by this CL: https://crrev.com/c/2755372. \n\nThe tast test was subsequently fixed in this CL: https://crrev.com/c/2770788\n\nI would like to enable this test as stable so that future changes to cros_healthd can be caught by this test. Since the above issue is not a flake, I\u0027m asking for an exception to the 20 subsequent test passing rule. ",
