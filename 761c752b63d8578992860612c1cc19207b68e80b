      "message": "Approximately, how long does this end up taking? I\u0027m wondering if we should always flash the firmware, even if it means the test always runs more slowly. I\u0027m wondering if it will be harder to diagnose failures if sometimes we flash and sometimes we don\u0027t (versus always doing the exact same thing). I think it\u0027s fine to try this though since it will be faster in many cases. We can always change it later if necessary.",

      "message": "One thing that I don\u0027t understand here: 7~17 seconds after this AP reboot (which should cause FPMCU reboot immediately), FPMCU reboots, cros_fp.log says:\n--- UART initialized after reboot ---                             \n[Reset cause: reset-pin power-on hard ap-off]\n\nNo matter how I insert sleeps before and after this AP reboot, this always happens, and happens on Nocturne, Nami and Kohaku.\n\nThe current test would succeed because we query fpencstatus before the strange FPMCU reboot. But if you run the same test again on the device, the second time fails - FPMCU rebooted without rebooting AP, so seed is gone.",

      "message": "Do you only see one reboot message in the logs? I think what you\u0027re seeing may be the result of the polling by timberslide: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/refs/heads/master/docs/fingerprint/fingerprint.md#Logs.\n\nIt fetches the logs from the FPMCU every 10 seconds, so there will be some delay in when the logs show up. However, I did make some changes so that the timestamps that it prints out should match up with the timestamps in biod: https://crrev.com/c/1769578.",
