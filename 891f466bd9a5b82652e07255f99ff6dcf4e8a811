      "message": "I wonder if you\u0027ll also need to change the Timeout of the tests calling this function. e.g. arc.TouchPerf has timeout 2 minutes and then we\u0027ll not really have 120 seconds here. Also, IIRC, default timeout for local tests is also 2 minutes.\n\nMaybe they can be changed later in another CL.",

      "message": "I think the only tests that would run into that problem are tests where the device isn\u0027t actually going idle within a minute. Previously WaitUntilIdle was silently passing when that happens, but crrev/c/2409612 fixed things so that that failure is now explicit. So I don\u0027t think this should introduce any new failure, it just might change what error a test fails with.",
