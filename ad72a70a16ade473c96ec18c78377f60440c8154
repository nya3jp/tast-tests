      "message": "This test caused multiple `crash.` tasts to fail in the reven-vmtest builders, including release builders, resulting in the build target being set to non-critical (see crrev/i/4863339).\n\nWe would like to set reven-vmtest back to critical as soon as possible and at this point the only failing test is a `crash.` test:\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/p/chromeos/builders/vmtest/reven-vmtest-direct-tast-vm?limit\u003d200\n\nThe chrome crash induced by `apps.SystemWebAppsReinstall` reproduces ~88% of the time, hence the couple of successful builds. Once we demote this test we should be able to restore the other `crash.` tasts that were demoted in an attempt to address the issue.\n\nI have also filed b/238173644 to improve the `crash.` tasts\u0027 handling of the case where session manager is down, so they fail with a more descriptive error.",
