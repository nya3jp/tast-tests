      "message": "Looks like there\u0027s no way around dealing with tablet mode separately for the shelf, but it\u0027ll be nice to have some additional testing and coverage for it. Just a couple more thoughts on tablet mode:\n1. Can we move the touch input setup inside of the shelf.go functions? Having to set it up from the test is less user-friendly IMO.\n2. Since tablet mode shelf behavior is quite different than clamshell/desktop, I think it makes sense to parameterize this test for each mode. This will ensure we\u0027re covering both cases and make test results clearer in case either mode is flaky.
