      "message": "Thanks for the comment, Oleh. I also wonder if this is right approach to solve the problem. The intention of this change is to judge whether virtual keyboard should be shown on different physical device conditions. New patch shows the idea how I want to use it. The code is not tested yet, just want your suggestion if any better approach to do it.",

Hidehiko, IIRC, you was working on hardware deps for Tast, how easy it will be to add new hardware deps?\n\n\nAt least we can start with using TouchScreen() deps and/or allowlist only on some model which satisfy requirements.",
