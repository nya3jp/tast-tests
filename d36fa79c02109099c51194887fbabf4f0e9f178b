      "message": "- also verify that the text has a suffix matching a suffix of the raw pinyin? the split location is ML-driven, but we should at least verify that both sides of the split match affix-wise.\n\n- if syllable split is already forced in the raw Pinyin text by ML, can we actually correspond the number of Chinese chars and the number of pinyin syllables precisely? I think it\u0027s a fact that each Chinese char correspond to a Pinyin syllable (space-separated token after Pinyin syllable split by the ML).\n\n(same comment for all test cases with only HasPrefix checks currently)",
