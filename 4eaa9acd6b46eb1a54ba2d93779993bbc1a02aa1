      "message": "can you make this an unexported field named \u0027conn\u0027 instead of making it be an anonymous/embedded field? otherwise, i\u0027m worried that App.Close seems ambiguous (either Conn.Close or the Close method from L73).\n\nvarious e.g. a.EvalPromise calls need to be changed to a.conn.EvalPromise then, but i think that this is clearer.",

      "message": "instead of creating a newApp struct here that is then abandoned (which seems like it could cause leaks if other fields are initialized later), how about moving the contents of Close into a closeInternal method, and the app-launching part of New into a launchApp helper function?\n\nfunc (a *App) closeInternal(ctx context.Context) error\n\nfunc launchApp(ctx context.Context, cr *chrome.Chrome, scriptPath string) (*chrome.Conn, error)\n\nthen:\n\n- New calls launchApp\n- Close calls closeInternal\n- Restart calls closeInternal and then launchApp\n\nthis feels safer to me. if it feels to complicated, it might be better to get rid of Restart and just let callers call Close followed by New.",
