      "message": "Is there any doc or pointer to know more about what/how it\u0027s planning to solve? It\u0027s a bit difficult to say without knowing the detail, if it\u0027s for changing/simplifying the default way of launching lacros it would help with some parts but maybe not all in this CL.\n\nI think exposing common chrome options to outside of lacros fixture conditionally by checking vars and the structure of having a convenient util that launches lacros from shelf for use by tests in this CL may be still useful. Do you think it can just go in parallel with that effort?\n\nAside, given that a number of the tests are in this scenario, it would be nice to have one working solution sooner than later to increase test coverage with tight schedule. Please advise.",
