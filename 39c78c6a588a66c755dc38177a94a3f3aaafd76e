      "message": "Not really. I ran a doze of ProbeReqFormat test before this CL, none of them is failing, which means it takes longer time to find a verifiable case. I instead used a trick to test the CL: flip the return value in RadioTapFCSValid() by `return radioTap.Flags.BadFCS()\u0027, so that none of well-formed packet can pass the filter thus the test fails because of no packet.\n\nAfter second consideration, a better solution is to write a dedicated mocking test, which is expected to fail, for 9 impacted tests (using Dot11FCSValid), by feeding a pcap full of malformed-packets into all tests.",

For anywhere calling Dot11FCSValid(), RadioTapFCSValid must be called before it. So combining these two together into one filter seems reasonable to me.\nHowever adding one more filter in to existing tests is a better practice to me, for now. Adding one line to code can be served as a notice to test owners. It also avoids hidden behavior changes in basic functions.",
