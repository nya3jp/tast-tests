In order to get online state, we will need to have an additional https server, which should be the next steps.\n- All comments as well",

      "message": "IIUC (didn\u0027t do experiment by myself, just according to the manual of dnsmasq), when specifying \"port\", dnsmasq will start the DNS server by itself, so I guess in the first if branch (`if len(d.dns) \u003e 0`), we don\u0027t need to set \"port\", since in this case we expect using the external DNS servers (d.dns).\n\nAnother question is, in the second if branch (`if d.forceAddressToIP !\u003d \"\"`), do we need to also append `${gateway}:53` to the dns list to make DHCP broadcasting this DNS? Did you check that if the IPConfig object exposed by shill contain this DNS server (after setup, run `/usr/local/lib/flimflam/test/list-ipconfigs etho_routert` on DUT before cleanup, maybe need to add a timeout in the test to avoid cleanup happens too fast)? But it seems that this part should works well if this test passes...\n\nThanks!",

So I believe we do not need to add that to the dns list. Please correct me if I am wrong here.",
