      "message": "in general, i\u0027ve been pushing back against making no-op decisions at runtime in tests, since it creates the false impression on test dashboards that the test actually passed (when in fact it really didn\u0027t run).\n\ni don\u0027t see any way to avoid that here, though -- the only mechanism at present for skipping tests is SoftwareDeps, which are derived from USE flags, while this is a powerd pref that we write directly from board overlays (or set via chromeos-config for unibuild).\n\nmy other concern is that if this test is promoted to the CQ, there\u0027s no guarantee that it will actually be scheduled on any DUTs that have set_wifi_transmit_power set to 1.\n\nif this test is just being added so you can run it manually to help with development, adding a \"disabled\" attribute (so it doesn\u0027t run on the CQ) may be good.\n\ncurious about what others think, of course.",

      "message": "This is the sort of test that we tend to do as part of our (non-CQ) WiFi suites, where we run them regularly on everything in the WiFi lab (~1 of each model), to get WiFi chipset coverage. This particular one doesn\u0027t actually exercise any functionality that *requires* the WiFi cells though (e.g., it doesn\u0027t actually connect to an AP), so I didn\u0027t bother arranging that yet.\n\nThis may be part of why kirtika@ was asking about a \"WiFi suite\" even for client tests that had no external dependencies. We have a bunch of stuff we probably want to group together for \"WiFi functional validation\", and it may not have all the same goals as tests-for-CQ.\n\nIn any case, I\u0027m definitely interested in getting tests similar to this run automatically, even if this particular one is very tiny/trivial, and even if it\u0027s not on the CQ. We try to monitor this stuff, and without this, I really wouldn\u0027t know if (for example), I got the driver paths wrong for some odd board in CL:1629093. Scaling Chrome OS with such a variety of form factors and chipset varieties means that we *must* have tests that will not apply to all models, and esp. with unibuild (which essentially discourages USE flags), these differences are harder and harder to determine at build time.\n\nMore notes: there are lots of other similar usage in WiFi tests, as not all features are available everywhere, and we don\u0027t generally want to draw out that matrix at build time. Search Autotest for TestNA in these sorts of files:\n\nserver/site_tests/network_WiFi_*\nserver/site_linux_router.py\nserver/site_linux_system.py\nserver/cros/network/wifi*\n\nAnyway, with my thoughts noted: I\u0027m interested in others\u0027 thoughts as well.\n\nTo put it back to you: is the idea that for a given test, it\u0027s sufficient coverage to run on exactly 1 board that matches SoftwareDeps?\n\n\u003e set via chromeos-config for unibuild\n\nAh, is it available there now? I didn\u0027t notice. So maybe I can remove the TODO on line 30.",

      "message": "it\u0027s not much work to add a new suite. instead of informational above, you could add an attribute like \"group:wifi_nightly\" (or whatever), document it at go/tast-attr, and then add a new control file similar to http://cs/chromeos_public/src/third_party/autotest/files/server/site_tests/tast/control.crosbolt-nightly with \u0027!disabled \u0026\u0026 \"group:wifi_nightly\"\u0027. you can set ATTRIBUTES in the control file to make the tast job run as part of an existing nightly wifi autotest suite, if you have one.\n\ni\u0027d recommend against following the existing crosbolt pattern of having both a group attribute and then a more-specific nightly/etc. one. see https://crbug.com/955640.\n\nre your coverage question, that\u0027s still being figured out. i think that the plan is to do something better once there\u0027s more flexibility on the CI side, i.e. ideally tests would be run selectively on the devices where they\u0027ll have the most impact.\n\nre chromeos-config, powerd definitely supports it. i\u0027m not sure how much of an effort you want to make here, but the cleanest approach would probably be to update platform2/power_manager/tools/check_powerd_config.cc to have a --set_wifi_transmit_power flag that checks the pref and then call it from this test. then you\u0027re not replicating powerd\u0027s prefs code in this test.",

Will see about a WiFi group, and the check_powerd_config tool.\n\n\u003e re your coverage question, that\u0027s still being figured out. i think that the plan is to do something better once there\u0027s more flexibility on the CI side, i.e. ideally tests would be run selectively on the devices where they\u0027ll have the most impact.\n\nAny pointers for that? Bugs to follow? I recall something mentioned generically back a ways, in the Grand Plans of Infra, but I don\u0027t recall seeing specifics.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t immediately jump on moving this to a non-mainline group, if it\u0027s possible to augment our dependency selections with something more dynamic. (In fact, ideally we could have it in both mainline and an eventual WiFi group.) I can\u0027t imagine we\u0027ll be the only ones with similar runtime determinations to make, and if we can improve the targeting for this, then I don\u0027t see why a test like this is not valid for mainline.\n\nBut if non-mainline is the going advice for now, I can do that.",
