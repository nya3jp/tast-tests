      "message": "in general, i\u0027ve been pushing back against making no-op decisions at runtime in tests, since it creates the false impression on test dashboards that the test actually passed (when in fact it really didn\u0027t run).\n\ni don\u0027t see any way to avoid that here, though -- the only mechanism at present for skipping tests is SoftwareDeps, which are derived from USE flags, while this is a powerd pref that we write directly from board overlays (or set via chromeos-config for unibuild).\n\nmy other concern is that if this test is promoted to the CQ, there\u0027s no guarantee that it will actually be scheduled on any DUTs that have set_wifi_transmit_power set to 1.\n\nif this test is just being added so you can run it manually to help with development, adding a \"disabled\" attribute (so it doesn\u0027t run on the CQ) may be good.\n\ncurious about what others think, of course.",
