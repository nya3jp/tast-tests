      "message": "LGTM, but I\u0027m still not too clear on the context here; why is it that this test doesn\u0027t fail 100% of the time on devices that don\u0027t support MAC address randomization (and aren\u0027t these devices covered in the hwdeps anyway)? You mentioned in $BUG that you ran the test 10 times on a sarien and got one failure. What\u0027s the source of the flake?",

      "message": "For the devices that does not support MAC address randomization (in particular, elm before kernel uprev), it will fail 100% with \"Failed to disable MAC randomization\" when calling SetMACRandomize.\n\nFor sarien, it is another flake with message \"Malformed probe request\". This CL is not yet handling that part. (maybe I should separate this error into another bug)",
