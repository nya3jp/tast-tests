      "message": "Hi Victor and Alex,\nSorry to bother about this test again but I\u0027m a bit stuck and not sure who else to ask.\nSo I modified the test to check for the enrollment error in chrome logs. I essentially made the test very similar to the https://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/remote/bundles/cros/policy/gaia_kiosk_enrollment.go test which also uses the syslog to check that kiosk mode started(https://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/kioskmode/kiosk_mode.go;rcl\u003dee386d9e00e83a7302bd890b8e1cf33a8ae6c42b;l\u003d134). However here I can\u0027t get it to work, not sure what am doing wrong exactly.\nMaybe I\u0027m looking in the wrong logs? \nSorry for the test not being very clean. I included a run below, the test can\u0027t find the Enrollment Error in the logs but then at the very bottom of the paste when I actually search in the test log directory myself I do find the Enrollment Error string.\nhttps://paste.googleplex.com/6743893455405056\n\nAny ideas what\u0027s going on here?\nThanks!",
