I don\u0027t see an escape hatch covering uprev in progress/recently completed for 5.4+ and disabled. On failure (wherever it ends up being checked), the error should point to instructions for the right migration path - pit of success and all that.",

      "message": "When you say build time checks, what do you mean?\n\nI am thinking of uprevs to modify the SoftwareDep to exclude themselves from the test. The failure message is a place holder for now - I just need to put in something to be able to see when I start updating the overlays that I haven\u0027t missed any, and tidying up the condition and messaging will come after that before I make the test critical",
