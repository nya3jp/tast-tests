Intel iwlwifi doesn\u0027t handle explicitly disconnect/reconnect either. And they start ping test right after writing to reset path. Can you align this design if two chipsets have similar behaviors?",

      "message": "I do not understand what you mean by \"Counting towards FW reset/ping once\". The idea is, when reset is done on Qcom chipsets, then it does not trigger an explicit disconnect and connect and this causes assertIdleAndConnect to fail. The additional time is given so that the FW can get the initiatialization completed. Other chipsets RTK and MTK undergo explicit disconnection and connection.\n\nFor Intel, the behavior is interesting, we can check with Intel about how the impletmentation is in the FW. But chipsets can have different behavior and our test need to align to those.",

Ideally, I want to handle this in the driver. Something like driver notifies once the FW gets back into ready state. THis can be through sysfs node. Also, this current approach is already done for ath11k and we have a TODO to handle this in driver and so I do think it makes much sense to add new level complexity around pingOnce which can have risks.\n\nThoughts?",
