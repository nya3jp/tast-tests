I don\u0027t see a reason that we need to retrieve milestone before chrome starts. Do I miss anything?\n\nGiven the fact that it makes no harm retrieving milestoneVal in the beginning, I\u0027ll LGTM the CL.",

      "message": "I moved it because I considered it was more clear to retrieve the milestone the first thing in the test as, if we are not able to retrieve this data, it does not make sense to even try to start chrome. At the moment this milestoneVal is only used once, but as we are extending/updating rollback functionality it may be needed in different parts of the test. As I was updating the test, I thought it would make sense to move it here so it is easier to use in the future as well.",
