Retrospectively, the two implementations might be similar in complexity, given that I had to implement crrev.com/c/3926253.\n\nFor context, this test would check the changes in crrev.com/c/3912395 / crrev.com/c/3910092 and crrev.com/c/3868999. The first two changes would change the group of /dev/cros_fp.",
