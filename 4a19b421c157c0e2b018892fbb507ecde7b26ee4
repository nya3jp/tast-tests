      "message": "(what I mentioned in the prev. comment):\n\nThese \"Extra\" parameters are not needed if your file only has one test.\nYou can \"promote\" them to the \"root\" level. e.g:\n\n  {\n  ...\n  SortwareDeps: []string{\"chrome\", \"video_decoder_direct\", caps.HWDecodeAV1},\n  Data: videoTestFiles,\n  Params: [] {{\n     // Also, you can get rid of \"Params\" if \"av1_test_vectors\" is harcoded.\n  }\n  }\n\n\nIn Tast, the guideline is to avoid \"generic/multi-purpose\" for the sake of \"just in case I might need this in the future\".\nIf you already know that you are going to add more tests, it is Ok (assuming that you are already working on the a follow-up CL). If so, it is good to mention that in the commit description so that the reviewer knows about it.",
