      "message": "Thanks for this change!\n\nWhile this CL is okay, you might want to consider creating two separate CLs for converting critical tests and informational tests. It might allow you to avoid reverting all changes in case informational tests start failing after this CL.\n\nYou can run all ARC-related mainline tests (including informational tests) by the following command line:\n\n tast run DUT \u0027(\"group:mainline\" \u0026\u0026 \"dep:android*\")\u0027\n",
