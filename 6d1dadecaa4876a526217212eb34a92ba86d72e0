      "message": "The test still does not check the case when a user is idle and a device is suspended (governed by PowerManagementIdleSettings policy). I did not cover this case in this CL and within the scope of BugBash, since I could not reproduce the suspension of the device after trying different PowerManagementIdleSettings values, needs further investigation. I am still not sure if it is a bug, however, the idle suspension does seem to work on my work device, but not on a DUT device (tried setting the policy via YAPS and D-Panel both, suspension does not work even though every other setting like Screen Dim in that policy work). Let me know if I should file the bug or simple comment in the code will suffice.",
