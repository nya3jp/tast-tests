For example, I couldn\u0027t find a GTAV-AV1-8bit-1920x1080-2997kbps.ivf.\n\n2) To the best of my knowledge, the license that applies is http://download.opencontent.netflix.com.s3.amazonaws.com/AV1/Chimera/license.txt which is http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/. Thus, we should link to the license.txt from our README. Also, I\u0027m not sure about the NonCommercial and NoDerivatives requirements. Wouldn\u0027t we be considered a commercial project? (I don\u0027t know); and wouldn\u0027t the .json files be considered derivatives ? (I also don\u0027t know). Even just extracting part of the streams may be considered derivatives.",
