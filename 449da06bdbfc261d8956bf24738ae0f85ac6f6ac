      "message": "Ideally, this error should always be 0, but almost always I get significant errors because the last samples that cras_tests captures are 0\u0027s because some of the played data is getting dropped. This means we can\u0027t find a perfect overlap for the whole input sine wave. What could be going wrong here? Once, I did get a perfect capture with 0 error, but I have been unable to repeat it.",
