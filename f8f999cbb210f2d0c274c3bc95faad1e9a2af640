      "message": "Hi Sadrul, friendly ping on this. JFYI this is meant to help rule out any issues in the histogram code / methodology. Once we rule it out we can probably remove this. The reason why this doesn\u0027t use PipelineReporter is to make it more different from the thing that we are comparing it against (histogram code).",

      "message": "LGTM Sorry for sitting on this for so long. I do not completely understand how this works, and have doubts about what exactly the metric measures. Specifically, (1) using the PipelineReporter traces should make it easier to understand what happens during each frame, without having to tie together the various other traces, and (2) metric measured based on trace-events in viz may not correctly detect dropped frames from one client (e.g. the renderer) when there\u0027s a second client (e.g. the browser) actively producing frames. Looking at a trace that includes trace-events from both chromeos-gpu and lacros processes would be helpful. But I don\u0027t want to block this any longer.",
