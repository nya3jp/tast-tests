There are a lot of problems with trying to manually start scans without going through shill / wpa_supplicant, and the workarounds that are done in Autotest to support this are pretty terrible sometimes.\n\nDo you have a test you\u0027re porting that needs this? I\u0027d probably rather see that get ported only in context of such a test, so we can review it as a whole.",
