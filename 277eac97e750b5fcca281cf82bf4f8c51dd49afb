      "message": "I just thought of something else. If we change the name of the test from ScanPerf to ScanPerf.dtim2, it\u0027s going to change the name of the test/metrics in crosbolt, right?\n\nTo avoid losing the continuity with existing data, maybe we should keep the name `ScanPerf` for the default case (DTIM\u003d2) and add the \u0027dtim1\u0027 postfix for the DTIM\u003d1 case\n\nUnless there\u0027s a way to keep the `ScanPerf` name for both DTIM cases and only reflect the difference in the name of the metrics? That would be even better I think.",
