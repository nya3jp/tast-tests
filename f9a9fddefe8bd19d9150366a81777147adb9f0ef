I think this is sufficient for the tests:\nlogin, loginGuest, and logout.\nHowever, I think for the other two tests:\nloginProfileExists, and loginMultiProfile.\nI need to use dbus_monitor to make sure that the function create profile is not called and only insert profile is called. \nSorry, I should have mentioed that in the commit message that I am still working on this part of the test.",
