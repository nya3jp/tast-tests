      "message": "Actually, it will work with the current rt-vcpu implementation because --cpus \u003d\u003d the number of the guest vcpu \u003d\u003d the number of host cpus at the moment. Our current plan is to add a rt-vcpu and to reduce non rt-vcpu by 1.\n\nHowever, we may choose overcommitment for 2 core board like akemi. In this case, it\u0027s not enough to check the guest and the host cpu num.\nIs it difficult to check --cpus passed to crosvm and the guest vcpu num, which is originally mentioned by yusukes@?",
