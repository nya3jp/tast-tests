      "message": "This should be done now but I had problems with mixed mode.  For the 802.1x mixed wpawpa2 the AP was being seeing as wpa2.  I believe this is due to wrong parsing in shill: https://crrev.com/c/3932691.\n\nI\u0027m trying now to verify this but I\u0027m having problems again with the build.  Had to sync in order to push the tast-test for gerrit but now I can\u0027t deploy the shill and the build is failing.  Once I\u0027m able to overcome this I\u0027ll mark as verified.",
