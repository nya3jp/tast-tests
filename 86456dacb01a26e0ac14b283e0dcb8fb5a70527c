      "message": "Few things with this function:\n\n1. Can it be moved to TestUtil and be renamed: GetCoordsFromRelativePosition? A little wordy by makes the intent clear and goes with (2) below.\n2. This function is assuming everything is located at: [50%, \u003cheuristic\u003e%]. Can it instead take two parameters: percentOfScreenWidth, percentOfScreenHeight and set relativeWidth \u003d percentOfScreenWidth / scaleFactor, and relativeHeight \u003d percentOfScreenHeight / scaleFactor? In that way, it will become a much more generic function that we can use in multiple places, and will remove the hardcoding of .5 (which won\u0027t always be true).\n3. Noted below but scaleFactor is an implementation detail. You can remove it from the parameter list.",
