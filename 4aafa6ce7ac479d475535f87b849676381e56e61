Not sure if this is relevant for future extensions of the vpnTestParams struct so the current separate boolean is fine as well.",

We could look into it, but I don\u0027t recall anybody complaining about xauth not being available in the UI, and we would rather work on IKEv2 than improving IKEv1 in the greater scheme of things.",
