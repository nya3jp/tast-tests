      "message": "IIUC it\u0027s common in Go to have a package with many exported symbols (e.g. net/http contains both HTTP clients and servers), rather than providing many smaller packages. And in this case, I think it makes sense for callers to call\n\n chrome.GetRootPID()\n\ninstead of\n\n chromeproc.GetRootPID()\n\nwith another extra import.\n\nSo, while I\u0027m splitting the chrome package to several internal packages for its internal maintainability, I want to keep public APIs in one place (chromiumos/tast/local/chrome), rather than introducing many subpackages.\n\nI\u0027m going forward with this change as you gave me CR+2, but I\u0027m happy to continue this discussion if you still want to introduce subpackages.",
