For 50 roaming rounds, we have ~10 iterations of netperf, thus the impact of measurement\u0027s tail (when we\u0027re running netperf and not roaming) would be minimal.\n\nWell, for 10 iterations, we could actually cut off the last iteration and still have enough of meaningful data.\n\nWhat worries me, is the general performance drop, which is even higher in download(maerts) case, than in the stream case.",
