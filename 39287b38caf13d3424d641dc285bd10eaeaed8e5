      "message": "I realized something else, it\u0027s possible that we kick off scans for reasons unrelated to the disconnect. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a good idea to consider the scan event time the time of link failure (and it doesn\u0027t look like autotest does this either). Is there a reason you do this? I\u0027m inclined to say we should get rid of it altogether.",

      "message": "Oh, I misunderstood what Autotest does. What it is really doing is: Determine the link failure detected time by (first disconnect event - start time), and calculate the reassociate time by (first connected event - first disconnect OR scan event). I agree that considering the scan event time the time of link failure may cause problem, then what do you think about using it in determining reassociate time? I guess there will be the same concern (i.e., starting to scan for reasons unrelated to the test).",

      "message": "It looks like using the scan start event is an old wpa_supplicant thing, and they introduced the \"newer wpa_supplicant\" change here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/autotest/+/250840/. I\u0027m not sure exactly what this wpa_supplicant change was, but we are certainly way past 2.3 so we can probably get rid of the legacy code path now.\n\nRegardless, I think it still makes more sense to consider reassociation time the time from disconnect to connected.",
