I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a good idea to consider the scan event time the time of link failure (and it doesn\u0027t look like autotest does this either). Is there a reason you do this? I\u0027m inclined to say we should get rid of it altogether.",

      "message": "Oh, I misunderstood what Autotest does. What it is really doing is: Determine the link failure detected time by (first disconnect event - start time), and calculate the reassociate time by (first connected event - first disconnect OR scan event). I agree that considering the scan event time the time of link failure may cause problem, then what do you think about using it in determining reassociate time? I guess there will be the same concern (i.e., starting to scan for reasons unrelated to the test).",
