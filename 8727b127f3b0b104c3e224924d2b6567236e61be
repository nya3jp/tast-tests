Suppose we made those plans *today*, we would still need to reference \"whitelabel_tag\" as this is the key that was burnt into RO VPD during the factory process until all devices which reference that go AUE... basically, we would have to continue planning to reference whitelabel_tag until the year 2029, or maybe even later.\n\nSo tast should be open to use this word again in the future as inevitably someone will write more tests for the unibuild architecture down the road and need to use this word.",
