I\u0027ve fixed this and am re-running the tests. Assuming they pass, I\u0027ll mark it as validated again when they finish.",

      "message": "nit: this can be in a different CL. I see other tests using the same variables such as diag_secure_wifi.go, mtbf.go, simple_connect.go. I think they should be defined in one file once. Maybe chromiumos/tast/common/crypto/certificate\n\nI think the test before this change was actually using the vars defined in simple_connect.go which is not good.\n\nuse in simple_connect.go.\n```\n// EAP certs/keys for EAP tests.\nvar (\n\teapCert1             \u003d certificate.TestCert1()\n\teapCert2             \u003d certificate.TestCert2()\n\teapCert3             \u003d certificate.TestCert3()\n\teapCert3AltSub       \u003d certificate.TestCert3AltSubjectMatch()\n\teapCert3DomainSuffix \u003d certificate.TestCert3DomainSuffixMatch()\n)\n```",
