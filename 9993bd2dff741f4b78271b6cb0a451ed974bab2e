      "message": "IIUC the change changes DUT status to do verbose logging, and keeps it after the test is done, affecting other tests that runs after this test. Is there a concensus about android logging about this?\n\nI think it is OK for now, because it is doing the same as existing code, but I thought it is better to restore the logging mode at the end to avoid unintended increase of logs.",
