      "message": "Why Tast Chrome.NewConn doesn\u0027t work for opening OS Settings:\n\nNewConn uses devtools protocol createTarget, which uses the NavigateParams.navigated_or_inserted_contents. This param is not returned for link capturing (since link capturing launch is async), and devtools protocol treats this as an error.\n\nNewConnForTarget works, because it finds a session (the one asynchronously launched by LaunchSWA during link capture) based on URL.\n\nMade a CL to update Tast tests to use LaunchApp + NewConnForTarget.\n- LaunchApp better reflects reality. Real users are unlikely to use devtools to open Settings App. LaunchApp uses AppService (which is what chrome uses for launching apps from launcher).\n- NewConnForTarget waits for a new settings app (based on URL)\n- https://crrev.com/c/2631653",

      "message": "That function does slightly different things.\n\nLaunchAtPageURL opens OS Settings app, then perform a second navigation (JS `location.href \u003d ...`). It also requires a UI condition check to wait to the OS Settings page to finish loading.\n\nLaunchOSSettings (in this CL) performs only one navigation (and automaticaly waits for the page finish loading.\n\n---\n\nI don\u0027t have strong opinions about using the first function, but most callers of LaunchOSSettings probably doesn\u0027t need/want a UI check. \n\nUsing LaunchAtPageURL to implement LaunchOSSettings is probably feasible, we\u0027d need to come up with a generic UI condition to wait for the page finish loading.
