      "message": "Why Tast Chrome.NewConn doesn\u0027t work for opening OS Settings:\n\nNewConn uses devtools protocol createTarget, which uses the NavigateParams.navigated_or_inserted_contents. This param is not returned for link capturing (since link capturing launch is async), and devtools protocol treats this as an error.\n\nNewConnForTarget works, because it finds a session (the one asynchronously launched by LaunchSWA during link capture) based on URL.\n\nMade a CL to update Tast tests to use LaunchApp + NewConnForTarget.\n- LaunchApp better reflects reality. Real users are unlikely to use devtools to open Settings App. LaunchApp uses AppService (which is what chrome uses for launching apps from launcher).\n- NewConnForTarget waits for a new settings app (based on URL)\n- https://crrev.com/c/2631653",
