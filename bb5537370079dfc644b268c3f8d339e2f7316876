      "message": "This does not look like a precondition failure but the test main scenario (https://tastboard.corp.google.com/test/security.UserFilesGuest).\n\nMaybe nya@ (cc-ed) can help why chrome login fails in this scenario, but generally speaking, I am afraid that the test owner (which seems to be you) should be the primary person to analyze/fix the flakiness.  It is a reasonable decision for sheriff/gardener to mark those flaky tests informational until the problem is resolved.",
