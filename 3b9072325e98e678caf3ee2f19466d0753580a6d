      "message": "Discussed with Prashant offline that the test should be skipped (not pass) when not testable. (no USB device detected when changing servo MUX state)\n\nPrashant@, I think we need to move this logic (change servo MUX state then check `lsusb`) into a dependency to skip the test, but it seems that servo is not taken into account in hardware/software dependencies. Would it be okay to have a TODO here?",
