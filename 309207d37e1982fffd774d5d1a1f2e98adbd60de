      "message": "We might have longer-term questions about how this kind of thing is supposed to work (possibly related to https://crbug.com/1070299) -- this doesn\u0027t really seem to be the best way to get reliable testing for future devices. It seems like a \"skip\" list would have a better chance of catching new devices. Otherwise, if we don\u0027t remember to update this every time we onboard new systems, we\u0027ll be missing useful coverage.\n\nA skip list would be a lot more work, of course. Maybe that would need to move into the hwdep package, abstracted as a useful property like \"Has HE support\".\n\nOr we just go with this solution for now, and work out the rest as we figure out how hwdeps are supposed to work later.",
