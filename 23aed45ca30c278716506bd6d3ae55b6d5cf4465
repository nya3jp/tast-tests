      "message": "I recommend starting search from the next line of the previous hit, rather than the next byte.\n\nCurrent HasMessage implementation is a bit hard to reason about correctness because it\u0027s half line-oriented. For example, w.partialRead can contain trailing newline in some cases, as opposed to its doc comment. This is not only an implementation-detail issue, but also its observable behavior is undeterministic and confusing in some cases, e.g. when the searched text (mistakenly) contains a newline character HasMessage can return true or false depending on its state.\n\nBut making the method completely line-oriented and removing w.partialRead, the logic would become clearer. And I don\u0027t think we have a particular use case where we want to match the same line multiple times.",
