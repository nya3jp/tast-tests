      "message": "Why is the regex more fragile though?\n\nI did this to wait for the expected password dialog in one step, instead of doing it in 2 steps, first getting the passwor dialog, and then checking whether the name is right or not.\nCan there be some race conditions related the fact that we check the password dialog in 2 separate steps? If the name is wrong, do we query the password dialog again?",
