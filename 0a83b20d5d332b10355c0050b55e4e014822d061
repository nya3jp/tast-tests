      "message": "Hi\n\nFirstly, my apologies, I had submitted this, as i was under the impression the +1 from ejcaruso@ was sufficient (is that the case?).\n\nBut also, IIUC these are following the naming convention:\n - They are internal files (since they are small text files, your link refers to external files)\n - they are in the data/ dir, and prefixed with the name of their test (disk_io_perf_*, the fio_* refers to the program which they are used with)\n\nIf i missed something please let me know and i\u0027ll get a CL out to fix it quickly.\n\nThank you",
