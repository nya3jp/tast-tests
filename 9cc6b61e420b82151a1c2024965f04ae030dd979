      "message": "I think there\u0027s a little bit of setup within shill, but it\u0027s less expensive than resetting shill and waiting for ARC to boot. I can split it up into different test file if that\u0027s the recommended approach too. Are there ways to add multiple test cases within the same files or would it need to be 3 separate test files?\n\n+Jie, to confirm if my understanding is correct?",

      "message": "I just take a look at the result of the current VPN tests:\n- reset shill and setup VPN server will take about 6 seconds (no ARC is envolved in my test but it is in this case);\n- time needed to connect to VPN server depends on VPN type, for the l2tp/ipsec used in this test, it needs about 3~4 seconds. (wireguard and ikev2-psk are the fastest, but they are not enabled on all the boards and thus not suitable for this test)\n\nDo we have a way to have several test cases with running fixture (and some other setup code) only once in tast?",
