As people add more app tests can you please copy the screenshot-taking logic?\n\nNext step is to build something that can show all the screenshots from a run at once, then in future we can iterate on better and better automation to detect issues now that we\u0027ll have a training set of historical data.\nWon\u0027t make tests fail if they break things, but that automation isn\u0027t necessary for release qualification or searching back to discover when a regression was introduced so still progress.\n\nThoughts? Any concerns/comments/etc?\"",
