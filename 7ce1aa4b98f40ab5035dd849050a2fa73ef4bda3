      "message": "+1 \n\nJacek,\n\nWhile it is a good practice to reset all channels to 0 at the end of the test, we should also set the attenuation to 0 during initialization (when you initially open access to atten?) as we do in autotest (link below) to account for cases where the test hangs or does not complete as expected. In such cases the attenuator may be left with any non-zero atten which can interfere with the following tests.\n\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/third_party/autotest/files/server/cros/network/attenuator_controller.py;l\u003d47",

      "message": "Here you probably might set not high enough attenuation.\n\nSpeaking about attenuations, we actally mean two attenuations: attenuation set on the attenuator (0-95) and total attenuation on the line (including loss on cables splitters etc, variable in different setups, adding another 30-60dB). Anything in the code referring to TotalAttenuation is as the name suggests Total (line) attenuation. Anything that does not refer to the Total attenuation, means attenuator setting.\n\nMaking long story short, if you want to cut the signal off, instead of attenuator.SetTotalAttneuation(attenuator.MaximumAttenuation()...) you should use\nattenuator.SetAttneuation(attenuator.MaximumAttenuation()...).",
