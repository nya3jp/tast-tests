It seems to suggest that the system is still booting.\n\nOur code will scan and stop the daemons 3 times to prevent that some daemons are hanged and not stopped. The log you list is for the 2nd and the 3rd times. From much earlier log, you can see the list is not empty and we did the killing.\n\n\u003e Wild guess: is it possible that it\u0027s too early after reboot to call gooftool?\n\nI also worried about that, but I haven\u0027t seen any failure caused by killing process too early.\nI can add a sleep() to waiting for a while after boot. (Any suggestion about how long we should wait?) But it may not help for the issue you mentioned. I have tried to catch this by add more log and local run 1000 times, but no luck. It only happened for a week on Tast dashboard and then disappeared.\n\nBTW, I have more concern about the DUT drop the connection sometimes. Do you have seem similar issue in other test?\n",

I suspect that this is because d.Command(...).Run(ctx) can block up to ctx timeout.\n\nCan you try setting a per-iteration timeout in the following way?\n\n if err :\u003d testing.Poll(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) error {\n   ctx, cancel :\u003d context.WithTimeout(ctx, 10*time.Second)\n   defer cancel()\n\n   ...\n }...\n\nc.f.\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast/src/chromiumos/tast/dut/dut.go;l\u003d189\n\n\u003e Failed to wait wiping finished: wipe_init failed\n\nTast has some logic to wait for the DUT to get ready in the ready package. It is currently used only in pre-run hooks, but it should be useful for tests rebooting the DUT as well. ready.Wait function contains some pre-run-specific logics as well, so you might have to refactor it a bit.\n\n\u003e Failed to reboot DUT\n\nThis seems general boot flakiness. It is known that a DUT might not return from a reboot for some time due to boot flakiness, e.g. crbug.com/1040286#c38\n\n\u003e Failed to reconnect to DUT\n\nLooking at logs, they seem caused by crash.KernelCrash. It\u0027s tracked by crbug.com/1040286, so you can ignore those failures on evaluating your test.",
