I suspect when the test was being written cros deploy was used which might have installed to /usr instead of /usr/local. Otherwise, it wouldn\u0027t have worked during local testing.\n\nIt might be worth filling a bug for the tast owners to look at replacing the /usr/local/libexec/tast/helpers prefix with a runtime function that provides the correct path based on where tast is installed (/usr vs /usr/local).",
