Let me know if you need additional context to review them.\n\nI\u0027ve sent you 3 separate CLs, despite them all modifying a tiny bit of the same code, because I found these issues at separate times, and I wanted to document the motivation for each in separate commit messages.\n\nThank you,\nMatt",
