      "message": "Hi Benson, with Prashant on leave can you take a look at this update? It will skip all HidWake tests on octopus boards. I am seeing that HID events still wake the device on octopus but the wake event is registered to an ACPI device in the linux device tree, not a USB device. That causes the test to fail because it is looking for the wakeiup_count to be incremented for a USB device. I spoke with Prashant about this before going on leave and he suggested just skipping octopus while I confirm that this is expected behavior and update the test to account for it.",
