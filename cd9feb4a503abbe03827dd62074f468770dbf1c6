If you found code duplicate on both network and cellular, we may move the common code to tast/local/network [1]\n\n[1] http://cs/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/network/",

      "message": "Well, looking more closely there aren\u0027t actually any co-dependencies at the moment, but I\u0027m still hesitant to split up cellular from \"network\". That would suggest that we should also move wifi specific tests to a wifi directory and the same for vpn. If anything I would be tempted to create a \u0027shill\u0027 directory and move shill focused tests there (which might not leave anything in network, I\u0027m not sure).",
