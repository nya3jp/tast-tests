      "message": "Is b.Count guaranteed to be non-zero? If not, this could report a wrong max value.\n\nAlso, would it be better to store midpoint instead here? IIUC b.Max is only the upper limit for that bucket. If we have no information about the distribution of the values in the bucket, we have to assume the mean is (min+max)/2.

I could probably take this out of the loop and just read the value directly in recording, and that would likely be better code. I\u0027ll send a subsequent CL that does that.\n\nI\u0027ll also add a zero check b.Count.",

      "message": "Wow, I think you\u0027re right, particularly about the highest value bucket. See comments in the Chrome histogram.h: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:base/metrics/histogram.h;l\u003d12\n\nSo I think based on that the 95% interval and the stdDev are probably both not useful calculations here, as they rely on that b.Max in the \"overflow bucket\" being \"a value that exists,\" as you say. Given that, I might write a CL to remove the computation of these stats.\n\nThanks for the thoughtful feedback.",
