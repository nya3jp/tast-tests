This could be one way to address the issue 4 with ash.CreateWindows in go/lacros-tast-use-cases.\nAs I saw quite a number of tests (12+) run into this scenario, it would be nice to come up with this util and let it deal with the life cycle discrepancy between lacros and ash-chrome.\n\nBy the way, I think this could be further cleaned up if we can revisit https://crrev.com/c/3426334 (a util to close any browser window with a URL). \nAre we good to go with this approach? Any thoughts? Thanks,",
