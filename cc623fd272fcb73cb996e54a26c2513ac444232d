      "message": "I see two sources of failures:\n\n* The coral-kernelnext failures are a fixture failure starting the ui, which has nothing to do with these tests.\n* A bunch of failures to connect to debugd.  These have nothing to do with this test, but are caused by another test generating feedback reports that block the debugd event thread.  These should be addressed once crrev.com/c/3816685 lands.\n\nIMO we should wait for crrev.com/c/3816685 to land and then confirm that everything other than the coral-kernelnext failures goes back to green before we submit this.",

      "message": "The alternating failures seem to primarily be coral-kernelnext, and those all failing with an error like `Fixture failure] ensureUI: Failed to start ui: context deadline exceeded`.  This is only showing up every other build because coral-kernelnext only seems to run on alternating builds.  This board is failing tests all over the place; it probably ought to be marked as one of the known issues, but I don\u0027t know how to do that.\n\nIf you leave out coral-kernelnext, the only other failures are hana-kernelnext on 15036 and two kled failures.  debugd on hana-kernelnext was repeatedly crashing on 15036, so every test that used it failed.  The two kled failures are caused by ethernet failures; they look like lab network glitches to me.",
