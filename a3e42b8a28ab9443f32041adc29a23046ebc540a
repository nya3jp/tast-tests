      "message": "Yes, both are necessary. I tried with only normal window. It didn\u0027t work.\n\nI tried several other things:\n- Open another Android app before opening this fake Google News app.\n- Open Google News app from arc.NewActivity.\n\nNone of them worked. Now, I guess that \"wait\" is the important part.\n\nOn second thought, sleep might be better as the intention will be clear.\n\nI know it\u0027s not a good practice to add sleep. But I think it will be the best way to describe our intention here for now. It should be better than doing unnecessary OPs to wait a time.",
