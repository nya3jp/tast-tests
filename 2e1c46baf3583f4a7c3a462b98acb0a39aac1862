      "message": "stevensd@ asked for a 4-minute timeout in this other Tast CL review [1]. DeleteScreencastItems() has a 2 minute timeout, and then it retries deleting potentially multiple screencast items at 5 second intervals, so taking 4 minutes to clean up out of a total of 10 minutes makes sense. Note that deletion is critical to ensuring we don\u0027t explode the test account\u0027s Drive quota, and usually takes much less time than 4 minutes from manual testing.\n\n[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3861378/comments/6a3d97ff_077890ba",
