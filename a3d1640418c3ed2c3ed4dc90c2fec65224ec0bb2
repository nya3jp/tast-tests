It is useful to know how fast/slow Android is.\nBut I think we also need the \"Total latency\". E.g:\n\n\n - measure time in host\n - inject event in host\n - read event from guest\n - measure time in guest\n\nAnd we can log the 3 values:\n\n- Total latency\n- Android latency (that the code currently does)\n- Chrome latency (also useful):  Total - Android.\n\nWDYT?",
