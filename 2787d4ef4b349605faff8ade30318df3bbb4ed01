      "message": "Hi Harvey,\n\nThanks for this effort, supporting Perfetto in Tast sounds great!\n\nArchitecture-wise, my first and foremost question is, do we want to support Perfetto for local tests? This patch introduces a library for remote tests, but as you may know most of Tast tests are written as local tests, so it would be a lot more useful if it\u0027s usable from local tests.\n\nTo support Perfetto for local tests, we have to install trace_processor to the DUT. I think this can be done in ebuilds, rather than downloading it as a test data file. We have to be careful about using prebuilts though because Chrome OS runs on multiple architectures. Anyway, installing trace_processor on test images would be useful for all users even if they don\u0027t run Tast.\n",
