      "message": "Skip this loop and check if configDataDir !\u003d ConfigDir, alternatively, only do this check if ReadFile errors out later to get a better error message. This will allow more flexibility for code using NewConfig. Sorry I know I originally suggested this check but I think it needs to be tweaked to simplify unit testing.",

      "message": "I\u0027m thinking about it, and it seems as if the purpose for this check is to let us know whether the datafile can be found in configDataDir. But we can check that more directly, as in this pattern: https://stackoverflow.com/q/12518876\n\nThe other potential value here is that it would tell us if we\u0027re trying to use a datafile that isn\u0027t registered by the test\u0027s datafiles. But based on behavior I\u0027ve described in the following thread, that seems to not be an issue: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/tast-users/c/xpbMQGnbzUM/m/YdNFsspDAwAJ\nOr, if it is an issue, then I would expect Tast to throw a descriptive error complaining that the datafile is not registered.\n\nSo, it seems to me that we can remove this check altogether, and perhaps replace it with a check for the datafile\u0027s existence. Or is there another reason to keep it that I\u0027m not aware of?",

At a minimum, I found it quite helpful when writing the tests, and I suspect that it would continue to be useful when modifying tests later.\n\nWith that extra context, do you still feel that it is overkill? I could instead move lines 78-83 into setupMockData so that we can verify the contents are written correctly.",
