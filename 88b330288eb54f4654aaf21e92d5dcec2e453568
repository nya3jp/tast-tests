      "message": "Tast Shadow Review: Two observations:\n- Based on the tastboard results, I\u0027m not really sure this in a state that it can be promoted to critical. Tastboard itself is saying \"This informational test passed in last 5 builds. Please promote it to the Commit Queue after 20+ consecutive passes\". \n- If you think the test meets the spirit of the stability criteria, can you provide bugs that show the issues we see so far have been investigated/fixed, and other testing that you\u0027ve done to show the test meets the intent of the 20+ consecutive pass requirement (e.g. \u003c1% flakiness?). You could run the test many times locally on the boards you\u0027re seeking to promote, for example.",
