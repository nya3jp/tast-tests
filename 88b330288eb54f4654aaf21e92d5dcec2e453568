      "message": "Tast Shadow Review: Two observations:\n- Based on the tastboard results, I\u0027m not really sure this in a state that it can be promoted to critical. Tastboard itself is saying \"This informational test passed in last 5 builds. Please promote it to the Commit Queue after 20+ consecutive passes\". \n- If you think the test meets the spirit of the stability criteria, can you provide bugs that show the issues we see so far have been investigated/fixed, and other testing that you\u0027ve done to show the test meets the intent of the 20+ consecutive pass requirement (e.g. \u003c1% flakiness?). You could run the test many times locally on the boards you\u0027re seeking to promote, for example.",

      "message": "These are mostly precondition failures with one exception. BTW these are generally actual boot failures caused by bad ARC revisions passing PFQ. In theory, arc.Boot.vm can even fail because of the same boot flakiness, so adding this test to CQ does no additional harm. Even if we keep the test in informational, we are unlikely to make any changes to the test (as the failure is unrelated to the test), and keeping the test in informational in fact reduces the chance of catching actual regressions. Probably we should mention such cases in go/tast-add-test.",
