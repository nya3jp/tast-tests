      "message": "One thing that I\u0027m not totally sure: Is it possible that the driver/firmware still randomizes MAC address when NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_ADDR is not set? The docstring of this option does not really specify the behavior when it\u0027s not set. [1]\n\nI try the test with the devices in hwdep.WifiMACAddrRandomize: mickey for BCM4354, elm for MVL8897. They both have no MAC randomization as expected. (others already have wifi.RandomMACAddress verifying the behavior)\n\n[1] https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/include/uapi/linux/nl80211.h#L5902",
