      "message": "I\u0027m not sure if your assumption is right, but what is sure is that there are 50+ callers of this method and this change affects many tests. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s too risky just to fix an issue in your tests.\n\nI recommend adding NormalizedUser method to avoid accidentally breaking those tests. If we\u0027re sure that no test is interested in getting non-normalized user names we can rewrite callers of User to call NormalizedUser, and once we remove all callers of User we can remove the method.",
