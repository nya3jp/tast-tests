With the menu loading asynchronously the Feedback is the first item to appear but gets pushed down when other items are added. Might want to update the `ClickMoreMenuItem` code to wait for the menu to be stable before clicking.\n\nIf you add `time.Sleep(5*time.Second)` after this but before the `WaitForFile` you\u0027ll see the paste never actually happens, the `WaitForFile` identifies it in the Downloads directory.",
