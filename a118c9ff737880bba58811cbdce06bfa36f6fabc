      "message": "Not sure that this addressed Shik\u0027s comment, which I assume was meant to drop this error if we have an error from the test body as well as from starting cros-camera, instead of just propagating this one up. You\u0027re still assigning the named return value here, so \"return err\" statements in the function body below will essentially assign retErr \u003d err and then we\u0027ll still drop the original error here.\n\nWhat I think was suggested is that we return this cros-camera error if there was no error already being returned when we run this deferred function, and otherwise we just log and then drop this one, since it\u0027s less important than reporting the reason why a test actually failed.",
