      "message": "Hello all! I spent some time working on refactoring the Bluetooth service to support Floss and believe this is in pretty good shape. I tested this change via a small custom test that started discovery, queried for devices, and stopped discovery via the service. Please take a look and let me know what you think-- feedback on tweaks to the service are very welcome!",
