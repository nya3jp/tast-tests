I\u0027ve done my best to make sure this won\u0027t break but if it does it\u0027s likely to be a change that got in adding a new usage of LaunchFromShelf. In that case, changing LaunchFromShelf to just Launch should fix it. Or, please consider reverting the new usage of LaunchFromShelf rather than this change.",
