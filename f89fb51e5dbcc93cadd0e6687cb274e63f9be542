      "message": "I just found out the root cause of the issue with kodama. For kodama device, each page in the home screen has only three icons. Settings and Web Store are in second page. However, they all showed up in the AppListItemView. To resolve this issue, I first call ui.FocusAndWait first to make the icon in focus first before I click on the icon. The test was successfully run on kodame two out of two times.\n\nPlease review the latest changes.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai\n",

      "message": "The reason the code is not there because we were still in the discussion how to move apps\u0027 dependency on ash. Anyway, I added one extra parameter for ID. Also, I just realized that this function was not self-contained. It will not work if hotseat is not visible which can be the case in tablet mode. Therefore, I added two more input parameters to handle hotseat. Please review.",

The current way is definitely more E2E, but I think it might be best to keep the library functions as simple and reliable as possible. The UI code here could probably be repurposed as a standalone test for expanding the launcher.",
