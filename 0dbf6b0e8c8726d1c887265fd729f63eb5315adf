As some convention (e.g. org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties methods) is not explicitly written on the doc, it takes us some time to try and know how it works. Write a simple PoC as a reference for possible usage in the future.\n\ncc dean and hsin-chen, also FYI. :)\n\n[1] https://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/dbus.html",
