      "message": "I debated adding timeout arguments to the functions in the module, but decided against it in the end for two reasons:\n1. No one seems to care about the timeouts so far, it\u0027s just 10 seconds everywhere for all UI find/wait operations.\n2. Timeout argument becomes less meaningful when composing functions like in ShowUbertray - we do a FindWithTimeout and a WaitUntilExists, both of which require timeouts. I guess we could wrap both of them up by changing the context deadline if we wanted?\n\nIn any case, I just used this universal timeout here so callers don\u0027t need to worry about it. What do you guys think?",
