      "message": "Side note (for the tast reviewer): I find it very hard to read `uiauto.Combine` chains such as this one. Without them, we can have specific error messages for each action. Separate error handling makes it much easier to figure out what\u0027s going on, both when reading the code and when something goes wrong. Maybe there should be some discussion about not [recommending](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/docs/codelab_3.md) `uiauto.Combine` anymore?",
