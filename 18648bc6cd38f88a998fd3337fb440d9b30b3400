      "message": "First, does it make sense to poll for app in task manager, rather than always wait 30 seconds?\n\nSecond, what is meant by \"in first page\" here? If the app needs to appear in the first N entries of the task manager (which defaults to sorting by CPU usage), this test will potentially fail if the other processes are consuming lots of CPU. Would be better to devise a strategy that scans the entire task list IMO\n\nIt also might be worthwhile (if other tast tests look for things in task manager) to have a more general utility for querying task manager status - is this test the only one that does such a thing?",
