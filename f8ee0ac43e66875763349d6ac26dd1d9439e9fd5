      "message": "I would vote for letting its callers decide whether to do that. To me `Launch` is a library code that can propagate its error to callers in the call chain so that they can handle faillogs along with ui dump or screenshot.\nIMO what\u0027s helpful in `Launch` is to append the error message with the lacros executable info, which doesn\u0027t seem to appear in stdout yet for troubleshooting.",
