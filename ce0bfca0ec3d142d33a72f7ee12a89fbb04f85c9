      "message": "I was looking into if it would make sense to use a hwdep for this, but from what I can see there is no precedent for using external hardware devices as hwdeps. Since this is dependent on a usb with smart support being plugged into the device at the time of the testing, and not consistent hardware that is always part of the DUT, I don\u0027t know if a hwdep makes sense. I understand that there is no TestNA result, so I was hoping we could better control when these tests are being run, maybe with a suite or a software dep of some kind? Do you have any suggestions about how to better handle this to avoid hitting the NA case?",
