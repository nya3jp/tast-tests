      "message": "Thanks for the review! Initially I just wanted to generalize lacros.CloseAboutBlank for Browser, so this takes a `br` arg and a `url` arg for convenience use by tests to close a browser window with a given url.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure if this could completely replace ash.CloseWindow in that \n- ash.CloseWindow is a method of Window that can\u0027t do the same thing without making more func calls to enumerate windows matching a given url and\n- this CloseWindow just depends on Browser abstract methods, doesn\u0027t even need a tconn from ash unlike ash.CloseWindow. Moving this to ash package would also mean that `ash` should start depending on `browser` package which is not the case today.\n\nWith that in mind, some considerations that I can think of are\na) if `ash` is okay to have a dependency to `browser` (and also replace `cs ConnSource` in ash with `browser`) this could be added as a new ash.CloseWindows (\u0027s\u0027 at the end) that is well paired with the ash.CreateWindows that has existed.\nb) or leaving it here but renaming to something clearer like `CloseWindowByURL`?",
