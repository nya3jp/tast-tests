      "message": "We have enabled vivid (Virtual Video Testing Driver) [1] for camera testing. But I don\u0027t think it supports feeding custom fake input. (not 100% sure though)\n\nCurrently, a more possible and feasible way to achieve this goal is using CameraBox to test portrait mode. CameraBox is a hardware which we can control what is displayed before a real camera when running tests. Therefore, we can display an image with human face so we can test if portrait mode actually works.\n\n[1]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/media/v4l-drivers/vivid.html",
