      "message": "If you create a new context in the calling function of TakeSinglePhotoWithTimer using context.WithTimeout(ctx, time.Now().Add(TimerDelay)) then this check and the timerOn variable wouldn\u0027t be needed.  WaitForFileSaved() would return the last error from the polling function passed to testing.Poll() after the context timeout elapses.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, I see that WaitForFileSaved() already has a built in 5 second timer - so the functions of TakeSinglePhoto and TakeSinglePhotoWithTimer both have timers, just of different lengths.  What about deleting TakeSinglePhotoWithTimer entirely?  Or modifying WaitForFileSaved to take a different value?",

      "message": "Actually, the |timerOn| here refers to the timer in the camera app. When the timer is on, after users click the shutter button, the app displays count down of |TimeDelay| seconds and then take the photo. It\u0027s a different concept apart from the timeout stuff of tast test and WaitForFileSaved.",
