      "message": "Hi Theo, after taking a look at the new 2 APIs and the usage(of simulating a plugging and unplugging event), I feel that it does not quite fit into the current paradigm. Keyboard service is in a small handful of services where we expose to outside of Tast to Google3 so there is less flexibility of changing it down the road. Can we consider moving 2 the methods else where?",
