This is a WIP of what I believe may help to address the spurious data of `DocsCUJ` seen in Crosbolt dashboard.\n\nDo you think it\u0027s worth continuing this direction? Let me know please, so I can proceed cleaning up a bit.\n\nPTAL Alexander here as well, who I understood recently worked with the NewRecord idea in this benchmark.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nTiago",

      "message": "A couple of general requests:\n\n1. Could you check if this CL produces a similar distribution of results to running the current test multiple times (and e.g. rebooting in between)? Repeatedly running the same thing could change the results, and we are likely interested in the time of the first docs opening, not multiple times, from a practical perspective, IMO.\n\n2. Could you check if reversing the order of lacros/ash tests changes the distribution? We\u0027ve had this issue in the past.\n\n3. Could you check if running all the lacros tests and then all the ash tests changes the distribution? Currently it interleaves ash then lacros, but it\u0027s not a very realistic scenario.",
