      "message": "\u003e can we use \"tests\" here and below \"These tests\"?\n\nI hit an issue where I went to run the test and accidentally wrote\n  video.PlatfrormVAAPIUnittest*s*\n\nbut it turns out the name is singular, rather than plural. It runs one test with one pass/failure message as well (since there is only one test). This version of plurality in the documentation agrees with the singular of the name and of the test. My hope was that by calling it \"test\" we would make it clearer to readers that the name is \"Unittest\" not \"Unittests\" and that only one PASS/FAIL is expected.\n\nIf having the test name and documentation be plural feels better, I\u0027d be happy to go back and change the test name from PlatformVAAPIUnittest -\u003e PlatformVAAPIUnittests, since Unittests was what I wrote by default without thinking. Let me know if so!\n\n\u003e also, can we do Video acceleration (VA) or VA (Video acceleration).\n\u003e people usually just call VA.\n\nI went with the first suggestion you gave as it is nicely consistent and clear; this README used \"video acceleration\" previously without shortening (https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/video/README.md;l\u003d147;drc\u003d1a6d75f3f68623109c6fda206c30c1a28dd816c7).",

I just tried to follow how other tests were described. For this test, I think there are 17K+ tests run with this, isn\u0027t it? I think I shared sample log with you. So little bit confused when you say only 1 test is run. If we consider as one unit test package?\n\nUnittest or Unittests are both fine to me.

In our test suite, though, this is all bundled into one unit test, video.PlatformVAAPIUnittest.\n\n\u003e If we consider as one unit test package?\n\nYep, exactly, that\u0027s what I meant by one test. The result of running video.PlatformVAAPIUnittest is one pass/fail result; it\u0027s packaged up into one Tast test. A similar example is video.Capability which is described using singular nouns above https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/video/README.md;l\u003d42;drc\u003d1a6d75f3f68623109c6fda206c30c1a28dd816c7\n\nSo based on that example I think keep as is; does that sound okay?",
