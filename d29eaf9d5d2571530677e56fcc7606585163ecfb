Thanks for the catch!\n\nNow LacrosFixtureVars is not actually used and removed from two fixtures - lacrosStartedByOmaha, lacrosStartedFromRootfsUI. \n\nBtw, reading up the line 20, if a caller expects LacrosFixtureVars to be referenced by all fixtures we can add it back and ignore it conditionally with a warning. Please let me know if there is any way to make it clear until this workaround is removed by new lab provisioning. Thanks,",
