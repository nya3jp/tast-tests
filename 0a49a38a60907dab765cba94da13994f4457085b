      "message": "Hi Shuhei and Jun,\n\nFollowing the merge of this CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2666200), I feel we should extend the current \"arcBooted\" fixture by allowing Play Store opt-in. Currently a fixture called \"loggedInToCUJUser\" is implemented under cros/ui/cuj/fixture.go. It starts Chrome, does PlayStore opt-in, and then do arc.New(). This fixture is needed by tests requiring Android App installation from play store. When I create a new category \"benchmark\", the benchmark cases also need it. So I created this CL to move the implementation to local/arc package.",

      "message": "Hi Shuhei, I have a confusion here. Any reason we always use literal string as fixture name, instead of defining a constant? With a constant, users don\u0027t have to worry about misspelling the name, and the name literal string can be changed globally.",
