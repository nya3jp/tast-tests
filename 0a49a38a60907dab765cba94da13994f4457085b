      "message": "Hi Shuhei and Jun,\n\nFollowing the merge of this CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2666200), I feel we should extend the current \"arcBooted\" fixture by allowing Play Store opt-in. Currently a fixture called \"loggedInToCUJUser\" is implemented under cros/ui/cuj/fixture.go. It starts Chrome, does PlayStore opt-in, and then do arc.New(). This fixture is needed by tests requiring Android App installation from play store. When I create a new category \"benchmark\", the benchmark cases also need it. So I created this CL to move the implementation to local/arc package.",

      "message": "Hi Shuhei, I have a confusion here. Any reason we always use literal string as fixture name, instead of defining a constant? With a constant, users don\u0027t have to worry about misspelling the name, and the name literal string can be changed globally.",

      "message": "Jun, thanks for the input of using \"Parent\" feature. But per my test, the play store opt-in logic has to be performed before arc.New() (when chrome.Supported() and GAIA login are enabled). If I define a new fixture with \"Parent\" assigned to \"arcBooted\", I think arcBooted will fail to do arc.New() because play store hasn\u0027t been opted in.\n\nBut I can move the whole implementation into the arc/optin package, with the chrome.New() and arc.New() logic copied. Do you think this approach is preferred?",
