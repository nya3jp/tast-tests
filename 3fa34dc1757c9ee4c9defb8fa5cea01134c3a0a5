      "message": "nit: Do you want to accept any object here? \n\nI see below, why this was done. I think that is kind of okay as we use it internally. Please add a comment that the account has to be of a specific type. \n\nIf we wanted to bound it by type we would have to introduce a marker interface. However, as accounts are only data structure it would be a bit artificial.\n\nExample: https://go.dev/play/p/3axvqWRlmf5\n\n\nIn the next CL https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3738122/\n\nthere are two types introduced ownedTestAccountManager and genericAccountManager. They hold reference to the tape\u0027s client and an array of accounts. Both types also have the same method attached - RequestAccount (accepting the same parameters and only returning different types), New, NewFromClient and Cleanup.\n\nI was thinking if we consolidate it to have one managed and that would be account agnostic.\n\nWDYT?",
