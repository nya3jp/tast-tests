      "message": "sorry for not mentioning this before, but this seems excessive, as you may report 1000 errors if pings are completely broken. since it sounds like you don\u0027t expect any of these to fail, how about breaking out of the loop much earlier if you encounter errors, e.g. after just 3-5 unsuccessful pings?",
