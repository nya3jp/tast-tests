      "message": "IIUC, if cros_healthd crashes during a test, all subsequent tests using the precondition will fail immediately. This will reduce isolation of tests using the precondition.\n\nIf you want to make sure that cros_healthd does not crash during tests, we should check it in post-test hooks. Then we can blame an exact test that causes a crash, not later tests.\n\nUnfortunately post-test hooks are not supported in preconditions. A good news is that fixtures, a recently introduced alternative to preconditions, supports post-test hooks. You might want to try it out.\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/tast-users/c/-vC6RR8fYlQ/m/AEd6EIHGBQAJ",
