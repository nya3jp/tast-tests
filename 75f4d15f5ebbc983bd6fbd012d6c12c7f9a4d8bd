Then the test would pass but we would skip one part of the test which wouldn\u0027t be reflected anywhere in the test results. So we might end up in a situation where the test doesn\u0027t cover everything it should without knowing it.\nWould the actual correct way be to skip the test for all devices that have a keyboard connected to them? I don\u0027t think we can do that currently but it might be a good idea to add a TODO for that.",
