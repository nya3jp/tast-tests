      "message": "This verifies that environment for several tests (perf tests, CTS test, AppCompat tests) is good. Good means it is stable in terms of sudden restarts of various components. In most cases this happens when GMS Core/Play Store gets restarted.\nIn order to achieve this we pass in such tests combination of flags \n\"--arc-disable-app-sync\", \"--arc-disable-play-auto-install\", \"--arc-disable-locale-sync\", \"--arc-play-store-auto-update\u003doff\"\nSo this test assures that passing these flag provides the stable environment where Play Store does not restart.",

Could you identify it and check it, instead of just waiting 3 mins?\nI guess you hit the issue in past, so maybe adding the check of that error instance should be the starting point, and then whenever you hit something similar, you can extend the check list.",
