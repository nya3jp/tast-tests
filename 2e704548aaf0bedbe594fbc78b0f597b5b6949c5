      "message": "SetUp should eventually reliably enable consent. There are some issues still (e.g. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/1994749 is fixing one source of flakiness), but we will hopefully not need always_allow_feedback forever. Can you maybe add a TODO to get rid of the DevImage option once consent is sufficiently stable?",

      "message": "DevImage option is always going to be needed for platform.DevCoredump, right?\n\nOnce metrics consent, etc are stable, then there\u0027s a TODO to remove ui.ChromeCrashNotLoggedInDirect and ui.ChromeCrashLoggedInDirect completely. I\u0027m not actually sure I agree with five-months-ago-Ian; there may be some value in leaving a test that tests the way the tast framework collects crashes. Something to discuss later. But either:\n(a) we follow the TODO and these tests are completely removed or\n(b) we decide we want leave one of these tests to test crash collecting in non-crash tast tests, in which case that test should continue to use --always_allow_feedback to match the non-crash tast tests.",
