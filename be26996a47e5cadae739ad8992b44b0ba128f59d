      "message": "Is the timing necessary here? 0 should move it instantly and since the `mouse.Move` above has a timing, that should still account for the issue that was fixed previously. \n\nI have some concerns that there could be elements between `loc` and `top right` that have `onHover` handlers, which may get triggered when the mouse moves in this way. \n\nThere\u0027s still a chance that going from `top right` to `next element` triggers those events, but at least we\u0027d be eliminating 1 of the opportunities for that to happen.",
