Please check.\n\nAlso, I just remember that there is reference to bundlemain/main.go/Main in ~/chromiumos/src/platform/tast-tests-private/main.go which is in a different repo. I haven\u0027t file a CL for this to change ~/chromiumos/src/platform/tast-tests-private/main.go yet. Should I file another CL for this change? I temporary added Main back to  bundlemain/main.go just in case I break anything. \n\nPlease advice.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai\n",
