I also understood \"output at %s\" to be be referring to the actual output instead of the expected output.\n\nHow about reducing it to something like: \"Printer output differs from expected: diff saved to %s (-want +got)\"?\n(you may need to swap your arguments to diff.Diff to make the direction of the diff consistent with this message.)",
