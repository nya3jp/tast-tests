      "message": "I think current plan is to run those hwsec destructive tests in bvt-perbuild, just like existing TPM-related autotest server tests. (https://crbug.com/1046586#c8, https://crbug.com/1046586#c9)\n\nI am not sure after soft-clear TPM 1.2 is available, how many tast tests will still need to crossystem-clear the tpm. Maybe now you and John have a better idea about the answer than I do. If one day we want some hwsec destructive tests running in CQ, i.e., they reboot the DUT but they are stable and quick, then we can split the control file into 2 and call one of them sth. like control.hwsec-destructive-information.\n\nnya@, cylai@, what do you guys think?",

      "message": "Wait, Leo, did I misinterpret your question? group:hwsec_destructive will be attached to bvt-perbuild in a new control file I am going to create in the next CL, and then the destructive group will run in the release builders but not CQ. Is that what you\u0027re asking?\n\nAlso, like I said in the previous comment, if one day we want some of the tests to run in CQ, then we create another control file and split the tests.",
