      "message": "Hi, it\u0027s not this CL but two other factors:\n1. The fingerprint Tast tests used to be skipped a lot (when they are scheduled on DUTs without fingerprint sensor, they are skipped), but recently we made a change to schedule them only on fingerprint DUTs, so the execution rate is higher.\n2. The test will fail for a few reasons that my team cannot control, the two most common ones are: (a) servo is not working property http://b/183404912 (as in the run you posted, \"[stdout] firmware.FpSensor            [ FAIL ] Failed to connect to servo: Post \"http://127.0.0.1:34935\": read tcp 127.0.0.1:34870-\u003e127.0.0.1:34935: read: connection reset by peer\";) (b) the DUTs in the test lab are often in HW write protect off state, and flashrom doesn\u0027t work in that case so fingerprint firmware update often fails: http://b/183623630.",
