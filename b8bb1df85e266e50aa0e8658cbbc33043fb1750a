      "message": "I see. I have two observations:\n- In the particular test you added this comment to, I just moved the `cleanupCtx` from outside of `s.Run` to the inside. This shouldn\u0027t affect the time the test has to run, or am I missing something?\n\n- I would think that most people that wrote policy tests did not deliberately make the decision to not use a `cleanupCtx`. From what I can tell, many people (including me) just copy paste from other policy tests to write their tests. Of course, you are the experts here, and I understand your point about tests that could now fail after the introduction of a `cleanupCtx`.",
