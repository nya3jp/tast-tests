See the relevant comment https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3494599/comments/80a13673_bb34745b\n\nI\u0027m not sure if wmputils.EnsureOnlyBrowserWindowOpen satisfies your test in that it has more specific checks for wmp* tests to see it\u0027s the only opened window that is visible and completed animation. I\u0027m okay to move it to ash if you want.",
