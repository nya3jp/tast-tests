      "message": "I think the idea is that if we can\u0027t ensure the TPM is ready then smart card auth is not available, so we just don\u0027t want to try and exercise it.\n\nSince the point of the test is to exercise the adding of smart card auth, and not the TPM, I think that\u0027s a reasonable approach to take? There are other tests which are actually responsible for testing the TPM itself, so we don\u0027t want to rely on this to catch TPM failures anyway.",

Ensure to me implies that after successful completion, the device would be ready, and so any \"not ready\" path would be an error.\n\nHowever, regardless of that discussion I agree that it\u0027s not entirely clear, and so a comment clarifying how we handle this failure and why we treat this as \"not a test failure\" would be a good idea.",
