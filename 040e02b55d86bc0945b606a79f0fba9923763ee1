This is also true of the arcBooted fixture used in existing, critical tests, i.e. Gampead/CheckAndroidVersion:\n\n1. https://tastboard.corp.google.com/test/arc.Gamepad.vm, \n2. https://tastboard.corp.google.com/test/arc.CheckAndroidVersion.vm\n\nI filed a question to the Tast team to try to understand what the best options are (https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/tast-users/c/kUtby1sXQac) but I\u0027m curious what your thoughts are around critical promotion as well. For reference, the tests are passing close to the same rates of existing critical tests over the past 7 days:\n\n(these tests)\n\ntast.arc.StandardizedKeyboardCopyPaste - 98.53%\ntast.arc.StandardizedKeyboardCopyPaste.tablet_mode - 99.20%\n\n(existing critical tests)\n\ntast.arc.Boot - 98.96%\ntast.arc.ContainerMount - 99.42%",

As this process is flaky, doing it a second time would mean adding more instability to the CQ.\nIf you can modify arcBootedInClamshellMode in a way that it is a descendant of the arcBooted fixture, and does not boot up ARC a second time, just add some additional setups (and those steps are stable), there should be no problem promoting this test to CQ.",
