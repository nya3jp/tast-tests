I did have trouble running the local tests though as they required a device which the lab DUTs were showing:\n```\n[Fixture failure] nearbyShareAndroidSetup: Failed to set up an adb device: failed to list adb devices after multiple attempts: context deadline exceeded; last error follows: no device satisfies the condition\n```\nI\u0027m wondering if this is expected or if I\u0027ve introduced an error. Sending for your review if you can see anything obvious.",
