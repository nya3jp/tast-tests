      "message": "Hi all reviewers,\n\nThis is a giant CL because I uprev the dev-go/protobuf from v1.25.0 to v1.27.1 (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/3252922). The newer go package generate pb.go files in a different way, so I have to update all the pb.go under \"src/platform/tast-tests\". \n\nI simply ran the command \"~/trunk/src/platform/tast/tools/go.sh generate chromiumos/tast/xxx\" on every package, so all the pb.go files are auto generated. I added the editors of each package. Please review the pb.go files that you edited before. Thank you all for your patience!",
