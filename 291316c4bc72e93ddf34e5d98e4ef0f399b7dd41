      "message": "The only path in testexec that wraps an error is in SeparatedOutput.  I checked all the places that call testexec.SeparatedOutput, and none of them were calling ExitCode or GetWaitStatus on the result.  I think the other places that are casting the err to exec.ExitStatus are safe because they\u0027re operating directly on a non-wrapped error.\n\nHowever, I did notice that testexec has unit tests, so I added the output-capturing wrappers to make sure they\u0027re all handled.
