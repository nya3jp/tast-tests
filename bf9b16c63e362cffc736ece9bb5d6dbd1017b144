This usually is used in response to a requested change by the reviewer, and tells the reviewer that you have made the change that they requested.\n- Clicking Ack on the comment will comment “Ack” (short for “Acknowledged”) and resolve this comment. This usually is used in response to a non-actionable comment by the reviewer, and tells the reviewer that you understand.",
