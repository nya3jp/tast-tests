      "message": "Sorry for changing the design again.\n\nI found that when we call \"defer func(pageConn)\", the value that |pageConn| points to will be passed before the defer function is actually executed so even if we set |pageConn| to some other values later, the defer function will use the original one.\n\nTherefore, I tried another solution which wraps |pageConn| and |trackState| into a structure |cameraWebPage| and I believe now we can use |cameraWebPage| similar to what we used |cca.App|. I think that will make the flow easier to understand and handle connections.",
