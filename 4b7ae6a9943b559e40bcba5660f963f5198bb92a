Observed that multiple apps are failing due to black bars on both sides of the app, b/195794074 (Instagram, Audible, Tiktok, Turbotax, Bitlife). \nSince the fix is in the higher version ARC-VM, Clamshell: Large screen test case will always fails for the above apps in ARC-P and also Stainless results are showing red for the above apps. So commenting this test case will help in making Stainless green.\n\u003e\u003eWhat\u0027s difference between Largescreenlayout and ClamshellFullscreenApp ?                             \nLargeScreenLayout will check if app utilizes the full screen or not.\nClamshellFullScreenApp will check if app can be maximized without any crash.",
