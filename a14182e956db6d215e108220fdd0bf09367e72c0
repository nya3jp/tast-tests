If you declare it here, it will be almost 100 line before it\u0027s the only one use.\n\nOther tests might be a bad example here :)\n\nWhen I saw that variable just before for loop, I was thinking that it was used somewhere in test cases description, but it was not.\n\nSo I think for better readability we have to put variable into the right scope, inside for loop in that case.\n\nThere are actually many inlined strings in the for loop that used only once (\"enter PIN\", \"Set up PIN\", etc), but they just inlined and test is readable.
