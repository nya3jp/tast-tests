      "message": "This uses a real GAIA login with real youtube application. It makes me really nervous for various reasons; real login and app installation takes long time, and it is actually flaky. Also youtube has a lot of UI features and experiments which are out of our controls.\n\nI believe this doesn\u0027t have to be youtube app itself; it would be an android app with the ability of PiP, and playing video in it. Is that right?\n\nIf so; please write your own test app and use it. Video should be playable through the standard VideoView (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/VideoView).\n\nThe test app code can be placed under tast-tests/android directory. Please also refer to ArcPipTastTest code base for handling of PiP in Android apps. Please also consult with ricardoq@ (for generic test app code base) and takise@ (for ArcPipTastTest code) for constructing your own Android apps.  If takise@ is fine, it would be an idea to modify ArcPipTastTest to play some video rather than a blank view.",
