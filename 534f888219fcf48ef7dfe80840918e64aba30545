      "message": "I think the caller (the gtest object in Tast) should be able to differentiate between the binary crashing and tests failing.\n- I find it quite dirty to add a parameter such as \"--pass_all_tests\" to the video_decode_accelerator_tests binary. I want to keep those tests clean and easy to use, and don\u0027t want to end up in a situation where we have parameters such as \"--ignore_this_thing\". A parameter to overwrite test results doesn\u0027t seem like good practice IMHO.\n- This would also mean I would have to add this parameter to our performance tests, image processor tests,... should I need similar behavior in the future.\n\nAs I see it, it\u0027s the caller\u0027s responsibility to differentiate between a crash and test failure. There are multiple options to do so. Maybe we should agree on some behavior for the gtest Tast object?",
