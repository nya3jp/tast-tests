Is that functionality covered by vivid?\n\nMaybe a bit of documentation would help here.",

      "message": "Nope because there is another type of camera: external \"real\" USB camera.\n\nActually, some Chromeboxes in the lab has an external camera. But, we don\u0027t want to have a label for external cameras at least before crbug.com/936807 is fixed as I mentioned in the commit message in CL:1530254.\n\nThe main reasons why we don\u0027t want to have are: \n(1) external cameras are not related to HW capability but how people in the lab set up.\n(2) external camera causes flakiness.\n\nDefinitely, I should have documented this somewhere. let me add it at the next patchset.\nThanks!",
