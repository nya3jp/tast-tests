Only way I know of is though Pre: chrome.LoggedIn(), but this seems to only work if another test logged in first. \nIs there a way to get a Cr with the remote debugging port without having to log out/log in in the test, and just use the current, already logged in user?\nAny help would be really appreciated!",
