That\u0027s why I added Sleep below.\nAs far as I know, after the issue (crbug.com/1002958) is resolved, it will be more reliable than now.\n\nMy understanding is :\nUsing Chrome flag reduces the flakiness, but we cannot use precondition and it makes tast slower.\nUsing ash flag is preferable from tast-test efficiency, but is flaky now.\n\nI think stability is more important than efficiency in this case, and I\u0027ll use Chrome flag.\n\nThank you!",
