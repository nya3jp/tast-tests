      "message": "Hmm, so I was playing with this again, and I\u0027m realizing this has some somewhat fundamental problems. It works for the case of deleting a known SSID that you\u0027re about to use, if you call it once -- but the recent framework adjustments make this loop over all possible storage of this Service (which could be more than one, with different SecurityClass), and if I imitate that, I have to loop and run this multiple times. But...it\u0027s not actually possible to Remove all services -- WiFi services that only exist because they\u0027re Visible in scans cannot be removed.\n\nThis is further highlighted now that we have removeWifiEntries() using the same code -- and if I adapt *that* to this same helper, I quickly run into an infinite loop, where I\u0027m trying to Remove() temporary scan-based Services.\n\nI could probably hack this some other way, but in the end, I think we *do* need the profile iteration code for some of this class, and so this refactor makes a little less sense.\n\nAbandoning now, unless someone wants to convince me this is still a good refactor.",
