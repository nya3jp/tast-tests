      "message": "Steven can you take a look at this first before I pass it to tast owners?\nI also created a follow up CL with usage in the rollback test. The test does not need to connect to networks, just needs to check the connections are preserved.\n\nAlternatives I considered which you might be wondering about:\n\n- Having the javascript in a file. That does not work for grpc services which I need during the rollback test.\n\n- Not having dedicated javascript at all but instead loading the networkConfig_ object on each call. That makes the code a bit shorter and less cluttered with wrapping. It is a bit slower: Without saving the remote 10000 calls to mojo need 12.928s. With saving 10000 calls need 8.722s.\n\n- Getting by without chrome://network. We need that to use cros_network_config during oobe. The tricky part is having permission to import the mojo files in javascript. I asked tast experts and it is probably possible to add permissions to an extension and then import the javascript mojo files with that extension. I would plan this as a follow up task.\n\n",
