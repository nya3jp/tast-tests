      "message": "It turns out that this test doesn\u0027t require an unmuted microphone to pass. It just requires a microphone to exist, and the hwdep.Microphone() doesn\u0027t work as expected. I reverted this CL back to patch set 2 while awaiting Li-Yu\u0027s reply in crrev.com/c/3849630. If we can\u0027t fix the root cause in hwdep.Microphone(), then at least I know that checking audio.WaitForDevice(InputStream) would fix the issue.",
