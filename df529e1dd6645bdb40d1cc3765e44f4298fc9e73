      "message": "I\u0027m a bit wary of this. I added the more extensive comment because the parameterization was more complex, but got rid of it when I simplified it down to just the fixtures.\n\nI feel like having every single test using the USS/VK text fixtures including a comment explaining what the fixtures do is...not really right? It feels akin to putting the explanation for what a class or function does at all the call sites.",
