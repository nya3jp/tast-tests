      "message": "Specific owner was added for the arcappcompat tests because of the following reasons: \"Make Stainless Green\" team will send an email directly to test owner\u0027s for any failures. I have observed that if arcappcompat tests are failing without having any specific owners, I didn\u0027t receive an email from \"Make Stainless Green\" team for test failures and got to know about it when Uma forwarded the email from \"Make Stainless Green\" team. I think, to avoid missing notifications, add specific owner to the tests will be helpful and also for easy maintenance of code.",
