      "message": "Sorry for the latency, I took a brief look at the network_WiFi_RoamNatural and network_WiFi_RoamDiagnostics tests. I think the usage is not very complicated so probably OK to extend current TestFixture. However, if things start to grow, might need to consider some refactor. e.g. move out the multi-router part and have a special single-router wrapping it.\n\nOne more question that is not inline: Do we care the IP subnet range of each AP in roaming tests? Currently each Router object tracks their own map of busy subnet, so there might be some collision.",
