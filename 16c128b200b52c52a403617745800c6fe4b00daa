      "message": "Hi reviewers, thanks for the feedback. Here\u0027s the summary of changes in PS5:\n- The fixture does not collect the upstart logs anymore, and only does the reboot+wait+sleep. Instead we collect and parse them in each parameterized test.\n- The test itself is now a local test.\n- Use `croslog` instead of `dmesg` to get logs.\n- Moved `src/chromiumos/tast/remote/bundles/cros/platform/fixtures/services_on_boot_fixt.go` one level up, because otherwise tast attempts to run it as a local fixture (not 100% sure, I might have messed something else up instead).",
