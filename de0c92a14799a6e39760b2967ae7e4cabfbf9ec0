Release Notes) recently moved to the Explore/Help/Showoff app (shengjun@, what\u0027s the right name to use here?), instead of opening as its own PWA, so the test needs to be updated to get it passing again.\n\nJun, should we also consider moving this to the apps package? I think it might be more appropriate there now that the PWA is gone.",

      "message": "Hi Kyle, thanks for doing this. I am already aware of the crash issue. Regarding to this test, that\u0027s more we want to add. \n1. Move the test into apps package.\n2. Parameterize the test with stable \u0026 unstable boards.\n3. Add checks on content rendering after launch (crash usually happens after launch. So app launch is not enough to detect crash issue I suppose).\n\nFor reference: http://cs/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/apps/launch_help_app.go\n\nWe have a bug http://b/166510008 to track this. Do you want to continue help finish this test or handover to me? Whatever look good to you.",

      "message": "Thanks for the info Jun. I\u0027ll go ahead and move this to the apps package and add the stable/unstable parameters here. Regarding 3, there\u0027s a small check for content rendering at the end of the test (waiting for the page header text), but more definitely wouldn\u0027t hurt.\n\nCan I turn this test over to you for the remainder of b/166510008? I think you\u0027re in a better position to figure out some of the trickier seeming parts (making sure Explore is always in the suggestion chips, how to show the notification, etc).\n\nAlso, is \u0027Help app\u0027 the official name we\u0027re going with in the tests? Let me know and I\u0027ll make all the comments with the app name consistent.",
