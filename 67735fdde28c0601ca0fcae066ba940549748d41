It will make the test less flaky and easier to read probably too.\n\nIf you want to add a check for the icons in ubertray being selected/deselected at the end that should be fine as an additional check",

      "message": "Thanks for pointing me in the right direction! I wanted to check some way besides the UI but wasn\u0027t sure how, but I was able to follow those examples and come up with something. Let me know if it seems like a good enough check.\n\nI also added checking the ubertray button for Bluetooth as well. I didn\u0027t add the Wifi one for now, since it won\u0027t show up if the DUT is using a wired connection.\n\nRegarding Wifi, I was able to check the status by looking at the output of ifconfig. Does that seem OK?",
