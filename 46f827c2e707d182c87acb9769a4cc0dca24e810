      "message": "For those who have the context of PreExist please feel free to comment further.\n\nTo me it looks like each mode covers different configs/cases for now.\n- PreExist is a handy mode to sideload any version of stateful-lacros\n- Omaha for the latest fishfood stateful-lacros\n- Rootfs for rootfs-lacros. \n\nGoing forward, correct me if I wrongly understood, would it be possible that TLS could help provision the stateful-lacros communicating with the Component updater, then may be able to replace `PreExist` or `Omaha`?",

      "message": "I think we\u0027re almost aligned.\n\n- PreExist is used in two cases.\n  - As Yuke mentioned, manually maintained lacros fishfood versions.\n    This is now major testing case.\n  - Side-loading, like chromium post-submit/cq tests.\n- Omaha, testing overall Lacros installation over network.\n- rootfs, testing rootfs-lacros, including uprev of images etc.\n\nThe key here is, what Lacros we should use for majority of tests.\nOur plan is to use rootfs lacros and to get rid of current manually maintained lacros.\nHowever, before its switching, we must have a clear strategy when rootfs-lacros uprev happens, and make sure it works to verify \"new lacros\" always.",
