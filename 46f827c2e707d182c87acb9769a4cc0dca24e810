      "message": "For those who have the context of PreExist please feel free to comment further.\n\nTo me it looks like each mode covers different configs/cases for now.\n- PreExist is a handy mode to sideload any version of stateful-lacros\n- Omaha for the latest fishfood stateful-lacros\n- Rootfs for rootfs-lacros. \n\nGoing forward, correct me if I wrongly understood, would it be possible that TLS could help provision the stateful-lacros communicating with the Component updater, then may be able to replace `PreExist` or `Omaha`?",
