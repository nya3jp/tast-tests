      "message": "The Tast changes (crrev.com/c/2649916) and the chrome changes (crrev.com/c/2646390) have no successfully been merged and uprevved. This should be good to set active and be reviewed! Left a couple of comments, one thing to note is some follow up work being done at crbug.com/1174939 which you may encounter when trying to close the Chrome guest renderer.\n\nYou have the option of waiting until the corresponding CL (crrev.com/c/2682086) is merged or you should be good to go. Please just resync to ToT and verify all your tests relying on these preconditions are working fine.",
