      "message": "Hi Kamil,\n\nThis CL is similar to crrev.com/c/3244287, and adds another Tast test for the chrome.login API. This also has the same caveat that it shares a lot of code with launch_managed_guest_session.go, and will be refactored after b/204177106 has finished.\n\nThanks,\nJit",

Yep, the DeviceRestrictedManagedGuestSessionEnabled is being tested here, but the focus of the test is on the API calls and session flow (launch, lock, unlock).\n\nI\u0027m currently working on a CL which tests that ending the session is done correctly. Will add the non-happy path tests after that CL.",
