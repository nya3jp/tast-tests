The rootfs only contains bash, the test suite, their dependencies, and a small script that runs as init.\n\nAbout 55 out of the 100MB are taken up by perl, and most of the rest is taken up by openssl, coreutils, and util-linux, all of which are dependencies of the test and cannot be removed.\n\nI was able to save ~40MB by switching to musl instead of glibc but I\u0027m not that there\u0027s much more to be saved here.",
