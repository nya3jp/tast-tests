      "message": "I\u0027m still kinda wondering if this login time measurement really makes much sense.  I asked Aings but didn\u0027t get clear answers.\n\nTo be clear, this is measuring the time of chrome.New() -- which includes:\n* the entire Chrome process startup time\n* the time of setting username / password\n* transition animations within login screen pane switching\n* cryptohome setting-up time -- only when it is not ready\n\nDo you think this measurement is a good idea?  Why?\n\nTo me, if the duration for the login should be collected, it would be the time from hitting the login button to the completion of the login.",

      "message": "Hi Jun, as we discussed, we will read login time from system login-times file. A new Cl https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2684932 was created for this purpose and Login time tracking is removed from this CL\u0027s fixture setup. Thank you and Xiyuan for helping find the right solution!",
