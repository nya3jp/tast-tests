      "message": "I\u0027m still kinda wondering if this login time measurement really makes much sense.  I asked Aings but didn\u0027t get clear answers.\n\nTo be clear, this is measuring the time of chrome.New() -- which includes:\n* the entire Chrome process startup time\n* the time of setting username / password\n* transition animations within login screen pane switching\n* cryptohome setting-up time -- only when it is not ready\n\nDo you think this measurement is a good idea?  Why?\n\nTo me, if the duration for the login should be collected, it would be the time from hitting the login button to the completion of the login.",
