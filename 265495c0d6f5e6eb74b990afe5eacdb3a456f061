      "message": "If we plan on supporting this test for mbim platforms or 1 sim platforms, this may need to change to a warning. \n\nOtherwise, we will need to limit this test to qmi + 2 sim platforms, which probably was your intention. The problem is that we don\u0027t have a mechanism to schedule it only on 2 sim + qmi platforms. We will end up hardcoding the boards on which the test should run(For e.g. trogdor). The scheduler will need an update every time a new 2 sim platform is introduced.\n\nShould we have a workaround similar to the one in shill?\nIf it\u0027s too much work right now, maybe we could add a hint about why mbim/single sim  platforms are not supported by this test.",
