      "message": "Curious why you have \"artifact\" case inheriting the \"informational\" from Attr and add \"informational\" in ExtraAttr for the others? My guess is: the one in Attr is for this test, the others might be for different Pre-s?\n\nOne downside for the pattern might be: it\u0027s less trivial to review when you promote the test to critical. The diff occurs only in Attr but reviewer has to go through the Params to know which ones are promoted.\n\nIf you have only \"group:mainline\" in Attr, and \"informational\" in every ExtraAttr, it might be easier for later modification. WDYT?",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s because only the artifact test will ever be promoted, so the idea is explicitly setting all the \u0027unpromoteable\u0027 pres to information. I copied the existing pattern in Crostini tests, but you have a point that it\u0027s more explicit the other way.\n\nThat said, it means that adding a pre and forgetting \"ExtraAttr informational\" means you land your test immediately on the CQ even if none of the others are on?",
