Ideally, we\u0027d wait for the crasher process to exit and then wait for all the crash_reporters started before the crashing process exited to exit. Another possibility would be just wait for the crasher process to exit since it shouldn\u0027t be able to exit until crash_reporter is done collecting data from it.",
