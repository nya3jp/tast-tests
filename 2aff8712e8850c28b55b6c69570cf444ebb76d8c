      "message": "Hi Hugo,\n\nAs discussed offline, an iptables firewall doesn\u0027t work well in out case since different google hostnames map to the same ip :). \n\nPTAL at this CL which implements a firewall using tinyproxy. The nice part is that all the failed requests are logged in sys logs as \"tinyproxy: connection refused on \u003cURL\u003e\".\n\nThanks!",
