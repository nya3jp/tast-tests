      "message": "With my nautilus, I have observed that regardless of the PIP window size, an overlay is used for bear-320x240.vp9.webm but not for bear-320x240.vp9.2.webm. As you can see, I have used this observation to make with_overlay subtests and without_overlay subtests. Can I rely on it for all the relevant devices? Miguel, what is the difference between these two video files?",
