      "message": "I was planning to write a fixture that ensures a non-logged in state with no user profiles, then decided that this test is not a good example for the fixture because of the restart, but now I realize that we do want to ensure the non-logged in / no user profile state. After experimenting with some \"simpler\" fixtures, I decided that the existing shillReset fixture (which also pops all user profiles) is probably the most straightforward, and has the advantage of grouping more tests together.\n\nWRT randomizing profile names, I\u0027m a little wary of that approach. It has the risk of proliferating temporary profiles over time. The pattern of removing any existing temporary profile before pushing one seems sufficiently robust to me.",
