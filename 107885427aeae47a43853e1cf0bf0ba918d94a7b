      "message": "Clar: at this timing, can we assume chrome://oobe/gaia-signin is already available?\nI.e., do we need to wait for the page in some amount of seconds?\n\nBased on the code, it is not the regression so it\u0027s not a blocker of this change, but as you\u0027re trying to stabilize this function, I\u0027d appreciate if you double check we can safely assume it.\n\nOr, if not guarantee, maybe:\n- wait for accounts.google.com webview, first.\n- if not found, wait for chrome://oobe/gaia-signin.\n  - If not found, return an error\n  - if succeed, wait for accounts.google.com webview again\n?\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s safe to assume that.\n\nThe proposed way is actually very similar to my first version locally (the difference is that I merged to logic into the first polling). When verifying that version I found that the |oobeConn| is already connected to chrome://oobe/gaia-signin in this case, so I changed to the current version.\n\nSome side notes:\n1. I tried to check the url of |oobeConn|, but it seems that only target id is stored in Conn type, and I didn\u0027t find an easy way to get the url from it.\n2. The first time (OOBE flow) url is chrome://oobe/oobe",
