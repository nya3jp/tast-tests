      "message": "what\u0027s the actual measured time for 2 retries? I\u0027m curious how much other stuff might be affected by this. (e.g., check_ethernet only does about a 30-second backoff I think) Could maybe use a comment too, since it\u0027s not quite obvious at first glance what we need to wait 60 seconds for.\n\nand dare I ask: is this something we should consider \"normal\", or is this something we should press on? e.g., is the lab DHCP server behaving badly, or maybe our DUT Ethernet is actually stuck? I know some of this might be a little hard to answer; I\u0027m just curious if you have thoughts or opinions, from looking at DUTs.\n\n(did you check that DHCP does indeed come up correctly after the test, but just outside our timeout?)",

      "message": "From what I\u0027ve seen, I usually see something like 3-4 seconds after the first try, then 7-8 seconds after the second try, then 15ish seconds after the third (but I\u0027ve never seen it fail on the third try). I\u0027ll add a comment.\n\nHonestly, I\u0027m not too sure how normal this is, and it\u0027s certainly interesting that the behavior is consistent wrt the particular board. I\u0027d have to dig into this to tell you more though.\n\nDHCP usually isn\u0027t given a chance to come up since we immediately tear everything down, but I put a sleep before that and DHCP does indeed come up.",
