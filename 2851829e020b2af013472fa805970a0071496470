      "message": "what\u0027s the actual measured time for 2 retries? I\u0027m curious how much other stuff might be affected by this. (e.g., check_ethernet only does about a 30-second backoff I think) Could maybe use a comment too, since it\u0027s not quite obvious at first glance what we need to wait 60 seconds for.\n\nand dare I ask: is this something we should consider \"normal\", or is this something we should press on? e.g., is the lab DHCP server behaving badly, or maybe our DUT Ethernet is actually stuck? I know some of this might be a little hard to answer; I\u0027m just curious if you have thoughts or opinions, from looking at DUTs.\n\n(did you check that DHCP does indeed come up correctly after the test, but just outside our timeout?)",
