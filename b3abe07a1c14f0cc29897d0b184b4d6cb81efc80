      "message": "Hrm, the intel_wifi_chip dependency is downright horrible, with major downsides: it basically means we will eventually stop testing any new device with dual sourcing, because they *might* have non-Intel WiFi on them.\n\nWithout support for true HW deps, this is the best we can do, so CR+1, but do we have a plan/timeline on when we can kill this fake SW Dep?\n\n(BTW, I\u0027m confused why this was ever a Software dep in the first place; we could have implemented it as a Harwdware dep still, with a list of models to skip. But that isn\u0027t the point of this CL, so if we\u0027re not killing it soon, maybe I should file a bug and get that resolved properly.)",
