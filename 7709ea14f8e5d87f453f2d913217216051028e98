      "message": "\u003e kill timeout 10\n\nRead the comment above it:\n\n# shill termination may take more than 5s (the default kill timeout) in some\n# cases (e.g. it needs to disconnect a cellular modem from the network). A\n# longer kill timeout is used to ensure that shill terminates properly in most\n# cases.\n\nThe \u0027kill timeout\u0027 line adjusts how long upstart is willing to wait for shill to terminate. If (on transition to \u0027stopped\u0027 -- e.g. on shutdown) shill doesn\u0027t terminate within X seconds after a SIGTERM, upstart will SIGKILL it.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the respawn behavior. Respawn has to do with unexpected termination (crash), not with expected shutdown.\n\nSee also:\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#kill-timeout\n(there are better comments about \u0027kill timeout\u0027 in other sections of that doc too)",
