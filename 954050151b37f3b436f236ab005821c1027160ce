      "message": "Sorry for not providing enough context in the description. I have expanded it and you can see more context in the attached bug. This CL both fixes the test and re-enables it on CQ. It was disabled because it was consistently failing after golang uprev to 1.17.1 and now that I have found the root cause and implemented a workaround, we can put it back on CQ at the same time. It was neither flaky before, nor it is flaky now (ran it ~50 times locally).\n\nTest calls the method indirectly via dbusutil.ConnectPrivateWithAuth.",
