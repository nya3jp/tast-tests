      "message": "file:// URLs are treated slightly differently than http(s):// (e.g. by the anonymizer, which will filter out full URLs like https://www.google.com/... in logs, and by `mem_usage_with_tab_titles`, which appears to use the URL rather than the tab \u003ctitle\u003e for file:// URLs).\n\nI think I\u0027d prefer to keep something as close to realistic as we can, though I definitely share your concern about having an implicit dependency on a website that might change its \u003ctitle\u003e. If you have suggestions on a page that might be more stable, or a way to make one, I\u0027m all ears.\n\nI\u0027m less worried about the network connection being down, because I think tast already relies on being able to connect to the device via ethernet to start running a test.",
