      "message": "This test is pretty simple. It\u0027s essentially just running \"ectool --name\u003dcros_fp fpencstatus\", which queries the FPMCU to see if the TPM seed has been set.  I suppose it could be causing some weird side effects on your tests, but very likely not.",

      "message": "Tom, please still consider disabling the test if it\u0027s all red. All-failed tests achieve very little.\nOr least, please take a look if FpUpdater is affected by this test before we draw conclusion. \nSee https://b.corp.google.com/issues/196924181#comment10 for more information. (i didn\u0027t see your comment so i suppose you haven\u0027t read that.) Even if they are just co-incidences as you think, it deserves more clarification i guess.",

IMO it is still \"possible\" (though maybe unlikely) for this one to leave some side effects.\n\nAnd thanks for allowing me to disable this test; we can see if any change after this CL. it should help validate some theories we have.",
