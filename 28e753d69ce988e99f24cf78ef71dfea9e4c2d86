But if you have to, might as well just use net.InterfaceByName(\"eth0\") instead of all this.\n\nhttps://godoc.org/net#InterfaceByName\n\nOh, and actually, I would upgrade my \"rather not\" to \"this will fail\" -- I\u0027m quite sure that there are lab DUTs where there are multiple Ethernet adapters, and eth1 is sometimes the active one.",
