I tested locally and lacros variant is working as expected now. \nThis obviously does not resolve the flakes, but it will make it easier for me to further debug thanks to having less possible points of failure.\n\nPTAL!",

      "message": "I almost feel like this would be a little easier to read if it were split into two loops, and then we could `continue` early when we don\u0027t find the UI nodes we\u0027re looking for (i.e. at L293 or L305, using the standard `err !\u003d nil` check).\n\nIt would also allow us to skip some walking of the UI tree; e.g. in the case that we don\u0027t find the account row, we don\u0027t need to bother looking for the child row.\n\nUltimately up to you, though.",

      "message": "I think practically speaking this will actually make the test slower, since the  profileRows.Nth(i) selector has to be run twice as many times now (and if we wanted to add an additional row, it would have to run more). Kind of seems like a toss up here between making it slower to fail (original) and slower to pass (this version). Ease of reading feels subjective, it\u0027s definitely a weird pattern either way, but I wouldn\u0027t really consider this optimized. We could also add an early loop exit if both rows are found, in the original option. Ultimately fine with either option but I just wanted to add my thoughts here.",
