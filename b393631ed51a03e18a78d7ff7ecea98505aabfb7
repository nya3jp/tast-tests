      "message": "the \"starting fresh MGS\" at line 84 does:\n- starts user session\n- applies all passed policies. The important part is that DeviceLocalAccounts will be set with all associated policies (if set)\n- restarts Chrome to pick up local accounts configurations\n\nWhat is also important is that defer mgs.Close(ctx) will clean up the policies (hence local accounts) and restart Chrome.\n\nIN CONTRAST, once MGS is set and you sign out and sing in it does not change policies, does not restart Chrome and does not change any configuration. Hence, this is close to the user point of view interaction.\n\n\nQuestion from my side. Where should such information be held to be clear for new people working with mgs library?\n\nThere is a codelab go/remote-management/tast-codelabs/mgs_testing but is it enough clear?",
