      "message": "If I move Launch from apps to ash, I need to modify about 17 files to do so and I am not sure how many tests I need to verify at this moment. I don\u0027t think it is hard. I just want to make sure I get a green light from you all to do so. \n\nI also have a few questions. Just questions. I don\u0027t disagree with any of the suggestions. I just need help so that I can understand better.\n\n1. Why do we not prefer to use mouse click to do testing? It is closer to what end user do, right? Is it because using mouse click is too slow?\n\n2. For pinning object at the launcher, I still have not figure out how to do it with ID. I understand name would not work for international locale so ID is much better choice. Any suggestion will be welcome. \n\nThanks for you all. I really learn a lot in the process of writing this test.\n\nSeewai\n",
