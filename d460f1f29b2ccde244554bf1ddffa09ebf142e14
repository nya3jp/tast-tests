      "message": "If I move Launch from apps to ash, I need to modify about 17 files to do so and I am not sure how many tests I need to verify at this moment. I don\u0027t think it is hard. I just want to make sure I get a green light from you all to do so. \n\nI also have a few questions. Just questions. I don\u0027t disagree with any of the suggestions. I just need help so that I can understand better.\n\n1. Why do we not prefer to use mouse click to do testing? It is closer to what end user do, right? Is it because using mouse click is too slow?\n\n2. For pinning object at the launcher, I still have not figure out how to do it with ID. I understand name would not work for international locale so ID is much better choice. Any suggestion will be welcome. \n\nThanks for you all. I really learn a lot in the process of writing this test.\n\nSeewai\n",

      "message": "This is reversed actually, I think the right move is to move the ChromeApp functions from ash into apps.\n\nAlso regarding mouse clicks, we\u0027ll use the various APIs when possible to more simply/reliably put the DUT into a state where it\u0027s ready to execute the test. It really depends on the individual test, though. For example, if we\u0027re testing some functionality of the Settings app, it makes more sense to use apps.Launch to prepare the state, instead of clicking through the launcher to open it, since the main thing we\u0027re interested in testing is the Settings app.",
