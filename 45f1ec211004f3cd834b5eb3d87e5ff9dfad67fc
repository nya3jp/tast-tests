Specifically:\n* It is actually not essential to use OS settings window to control bluetooth. Please use the dbus interface.\n* Aings told me that gmail website should be used for CUJs. Please rewrite the code around gmail control.",

      "message": "Jun,\n\n- We couldn\u0027t find any examples of using DBUS to connect a Bluetooth devices. There are examples to enable / disable BT though. So we didn\u0027t change the Bluetooth package and still keep the BT device control from UI. But if you know any existing examples of controlling BT device (connect/disconnect) from DBUS, please let us know and we can modify.\n- Jane modified the gmail package and now it supports both web and APP. CUJ or other UI test can choose what they need.",

      "message": "As I noted in the email, bluetooth dbus protocol is publicly available, and I believe that\u0027s possible in chromeos devices (and tast has the feature to communicate through dbus). The existing \"bluetooth\" package does not have the control, so you will have to expand that. That would be a high engineering cost indeed, but I think that\u0027s worth doing.\nI am not familiar with how those dbus messages to be used.\n\nAlternatively there\u0027s bluetooth related extension APIs.  You could use that (that\u0027s still indirect but better and faster than controlling through UI, I think).\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/heads/master/extensions/common/api/bluetooth_private.idl\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/heads/master/extensions/common/api/bluetooth.idl\n\n\nFor Gmail, my understanding is *NOT* using the Android version of it, so please remove that until necessary. Please let me know if that\u0027s wrong.",
