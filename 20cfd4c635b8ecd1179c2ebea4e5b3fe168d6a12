      "message": "It seems that after removing the 0.5 sleeping from the vpn package, \"vpn\" inteface may not be there when we reach here. When that happens, `reach` will try to ping \"vpn.google.com\" -- it got 3 addresses resolved, sometimes none of them is reachable within 3 seconds timeout, and thus a total 9 seconds is required in each poll, so the original 10 seconds is not enough and thus the test is flaky.\n\nTwo changes here:\n1) Shorten the timeout to execute `reach`, 2 seconds should be long enough since the target address is local;\n2) Even with 1), I observed that this Poll() still takes 9 seconds (not sure if it is expected), so extend the timeout to 20 seconds at the same time.",
