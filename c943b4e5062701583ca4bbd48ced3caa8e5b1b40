      "message": "(Cont.) Looks like in the current this is not even used. So,\n1. I think just removing it is sensible to just remove this. With renamed interface I think is better above, I have no problem with the readability for now.\n2. If we want to keep this and remove the function argument, I am also okay with it too.\n3. Despite of 2., I would vote for 1., since we only call |GetTokenForUser| in one place.\n\nThough, I am not golang expert so I would hope to get some challenges from Abe san, still.",

      "message": "Fair enough.\n\nThough in many cases of hwsec, because of refactoring going on, it is expected that we have potentially several ways to do one thing (e.g., calling cryptohomed to enroll, calling attestationd to enroll, calling the command line tool to enroll, sending the dbus message to enroll...), I did use interfaces for that; in this case I think we need John\u0027s input.\n\nHey, John:\nDo you expect to implement |GetTokenForUser| in a different way soon? IIUC, even for cryptohome proxy we are still using cryptohome binary, no?",
