      "message": "(Cont.) Looks like in the current this is not even used. So,\n1. I think just removing it is sensible to just remove this. With renamed interface I think is better above, I have no problem with the readability for now.\n2. If we want to keep this and remove the function argument, I am also okay with it too.\n3. Despite of 2., I would vote for 1., since we only call |GetTokenForUser| in one place.\n\nThough, I am not golang expert so I would hope to get some challenges from Abe san, still.",
