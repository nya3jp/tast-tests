      "message": "ok, I just saw go/tast-shadow-review and tast/gerrit.gwsq\n\nwe will probably want to follow the policy test example and limit our ownership to files in cros/ui.\n\nI\u0027m ok with following this protocol, but I\u0027m also wondering if we should revisit it? At the time this was written, there were only 2 reviewers, and now there are 2 dozen. Perhaps it\u0027s no longer desirable or appropriate to have so many top level owners, and we should have more owners of subdirectories? \n\nMy main concern is burdening Xiyuan (who is also owner of much of chromeos) with additional reviews. Xiyuan gets the most review requests in our team, and I don\u0027t want to create additional work for him if it can be avoided. Ideally he would receive review requests for cros/ui and not the rest.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.",
