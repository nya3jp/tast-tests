For example, in TaskSwitchCUJ, I\u0027d prefer to be either near the top or middle of the doc, so when I do my scroll down + scroll up, I don\u0027t immediately hit the bottom of the document. \n\nOne idea could be to let users pass in a isBottom bool, and if so, concatenate `?disco\u003dAAAAP6EbSF8` to the end of the link?",
