      "message": "hmm, did you ever resolve these?\nhttps://b.corp.google.com/issues/186458965\nhttps://b.corp.google.com/issues/186800736 (I guess this one is the test-specific issue)\n\nIf not, then I think you\u0027re reintroducing flake that we spent a lot of time on before -- that we might roam sometime during AP setup and scan, so the roam attempt will do nothing. Or I could be wrong, if I\u0027m not remembering details right, or if BSS TM was different enough from other roam cases.\n\nIf the problem is just the timeout, can\u0027t we increase it?",
