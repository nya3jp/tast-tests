Category: general coding tools; Sub-category: Main 4:4:4 16 Intra profile (with general_lower_bit_rate_constraint_flag=1)

The purpose of the stream is to exercise the extended precision processing function,
part of a set of streams designed to examine a range of bit depths
The stream consists of a concatenation of two sequences of one frame each
 - the first with extended_precision_processing_flag=0
 - the second with extended_precision_processing_flag=1
Video is 4:4:4 8 bit GBR
