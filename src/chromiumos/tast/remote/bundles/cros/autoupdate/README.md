## How to run autoupdate tests

So far the tests can only be run on leased devices from the test lab.
Note that TLW service instructions are subject to change. Please update the
documentation if the instructions don't work anymore.

Install the TLW service.
```bash
mkdir chrome_infra
cd chrome_infra
fetch infra   # or fetch infra_internal if you are a Googler
eval $(infra/go/env.py)
```

Add `$HOME/chrome_infra/infra/go` to your `$GOPATH` for example by appending
the following to `~/.profile`.
```
export GOPATH="$GOPATH:$HOME/chrome_infra/infra/go"
```

Start the TLW service.
```bash
cd ~/chrome_infra/infra/go/src/infra/cros/cmd
(cd prototype-tlw && go run . -port 7151) &
```

Make sure that you can access the device without a password, for example by
using ssh keys.

Create ssh tunnel to access DUT from inside chroot.
```bash
autossh -L 2200:localhost:22 root@<dut>
```

Run the test inside chroot.
```
(chroot) tast run -var=updateutil.tlwAddress="localhost:7151" localhost:2200 <test_name>
```
