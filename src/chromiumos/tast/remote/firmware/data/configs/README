# Overview

This directory contains platform-specific configs used for firmware testing.

DEFAULTS.json contains default values, and documentation, for all configurable
properties.

Properties are overridden based on the DUT's board, and sometimes model.
Each board has a JSON file in this directory, '${BOARD}.json'.

Some config files inherit properties from a parent file, i.e. a reference board.

Some boards also have a "models" property, allowing specific models to override
certain values.

The precedence goes from general to specific: DEFAULTS < parent < board < model.

# Updating the configs

Currently, these config files are duplicated between Autotest and Tast.
This is a temporary measure.
For more information, please see go/cros-fw-testing-configs.

When updating configs in one location, *please also update the other location.*
This will prevent the two repositories from falling out-of-sync.

Autotest configs: $AUTOTEST/server/cros/faft/configs/
Tast configs: $TAST_TESTS/src/chromiumos/tast/remote/firmware/data/configs/
