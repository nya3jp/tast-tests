// EC firmware for the quota pool (which backs the CQ) is changed only after a candidate build goes through FAFT (which would
// mean the EC is likely to be behaving as a responder to I2C or SPI messages).  Note that this test is similar to
// firmware.ECVersion, but doesn't depend on ectool or the EC reporting its version in any particular format, so a failure is
// likely to be associated with a kernel change.  See
// https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/bd0447f72de0963129612bf18202204d5b25e133/ for an example
// where a change to a SPI driver prevented /dev/cros_ec from being created (ultimately discovered when flashrom invocations
// involving the EC failed).
