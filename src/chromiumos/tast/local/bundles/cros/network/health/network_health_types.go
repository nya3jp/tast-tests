// A simplified version of the types in network_health.mojom,
// network_types.mojom and url.mojom to be used in tests. The JSON marshalling
// comments are required for passing structs to javascript. Note that only
// fields relevant to the tast tests are included.

// There are fields that should not be included in the json object at all (not
// even as an empty object). Setting the optional fields that are of the type
// struct as a pointer allows them to be nullable and to not appear in the json
// object if not provided.

// network_types.mojom types

// PortalState describes the captive portal state. Provides additional details
// when the connection state is Portal.
