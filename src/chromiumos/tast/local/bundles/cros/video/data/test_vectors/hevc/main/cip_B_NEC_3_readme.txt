Bitstream file name: cip_B_NEC_3.hevc

Conformance point: HM-12.0

Explanation of bitstream features: The bitstream contains an I-picture and 4 P-pictures. Each picture contains only one slice. constrained_intra_pred_flag is equal to 1.

Functional stage: Test the reference sample substitution process for intra sample prediction.

Purpose: Check that decoder can correctly decode slices of coded pictures containing intra PUs with unavailable samples for intra prediction.

Picture size: 416x240 (Minimum level of this bitstream is 2.0.)

Frame rate: 30fps
