Software version: HM-10.0

Description :
All slices are coded as I or P slices. Each picture contains only one slice.
num_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1 is  equal to 0, num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1 is  equal to 0 and num_ref_idx_active_override_flag is equal to 0.

Purpose :
Check whether motion vector prediction candidate generation and signalling perform correctly when MV scaling is not needed for spatial MVP candidate generation (All inter-coded PUs within the same slice have the same inter_pred_idc and ref_idx_l0).
