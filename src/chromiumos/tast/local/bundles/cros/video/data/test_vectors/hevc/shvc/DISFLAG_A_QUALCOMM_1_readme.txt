Bitstream file name: DISFLAG_A_QUALCOMM_1.hevc

Bitstream feature name: Discardable picture

Bitstream feature description:
Conformance SHVC in which one or more pictures is marked as discardable picture.
Conformaning decoder is expected to be able to decode the bitstream.

- Coding structure: Random access main
- Number of Frames - 8
- One of the picture in the bitstream has value of discardable_flag equal to 1 in its slice header.

Output Layer Sets:
- OLS_0 -   Layer: 0, PTL Idx: 1 (Main 3.1)
- OLS_1 -   Layer: 0, PTL Idx: 1 (Main 3.1)
	    Layer: 1, PTL Idx: 2 (Scalable Main 4.1)

Number of layers: 2

Profile, Tier, Level information: Num PTL = 3
- PTL_Idx 0 - Profile: MAIN [V1 Whole Bitstream PTL]
              Level: 4.1
- PTL_Idx 1 - Profile: MAIN [Base layer PTL]
              Level: 3.1
- PTL_Idx 2 - Profile: SCALABLE MAIN [Ehhancement layer PTL]
              Level: 4.1

Each layer resolution:
- Layer 0 resolution - Output: 960x540
- Layer 1 resolution - Output: 1920x1080

Frame rate: 50 fps for both layers

SHM Version: SHM8.0
