Name: 3DHC_DT_A
Specification: The bitstream is coded with random access configuration as well as 3-view configuration. In addition to ARP, sub-PU inter-view motion prediction and illumination compensation, depth refined disparity vector derivation (DoNBDV) is enabled (with depth_ref_enabled_flag set equal to 1) for non-base texture views.
Functional stage: Decoding of three views with DoNBDV enabled for texture views.
Purpose: To conform the DoNBDV for texture.

Software: HTM-15.1
