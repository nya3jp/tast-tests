Spec version: HM11.0
Profile: Main
Level: 2
(Category: Entropy Coding; Sub-category: Maximum number of bins)

The purpose of the stream is to reach within 95% of the maximum number of bins per LCU based on the 5120 bits per 16x16 LCU constraint (IPCM is enabled).

===============================
Statistics for LCU with most bins:
===============================
maxTotalBits 5102
maxTotalBins 5836

The bitstream contains I and B slices and one slice per picture. Random access configuration.

===============================
Revision note:
===============================
In the 5th version, 112th's CTU bit size issue in the first picture was revised by editing its chroma SAO parameters.
