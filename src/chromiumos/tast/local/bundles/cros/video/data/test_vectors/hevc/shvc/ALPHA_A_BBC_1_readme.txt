Bitstream file name: ALPHA_A_BBC_1.hevc

Bitstream feature: texture signal plus alpha plane encoded as auxiliary picture along with the associated SEI message. The following encoder parameter have been used to specify the information associated with the alpha channel:
SEIAlphaCancelFlag           : 0
SEIAlphaUseIdc               : 0
SEIAlphaBitDepthMinus8       : 0
SEIAlphaTransparentValue     : 0
SEIAlphaOpaqueValue          : 255
SEIAlphaIncrementFlag        : 0
SEIAlphaClipFlag             : 1
SEIAlphaClipType             : 0
