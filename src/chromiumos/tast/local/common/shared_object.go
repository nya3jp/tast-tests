// SharedObjectsForService allows services to shared states of important objects, such as
// chrome and arc. While this provides acccess to the important objects, the lifecycle management
// of these objects is not the responsibility of this struct, instead services collectively
// should manage the lifecycle of these objects.
// A common pattern is to include a reference during Service instantiation and registration. e.g.
//  testing.AddService(&testing.Service{
//	  Register: func(srv *grpc.Server, s *testing.ServiceState) {
//			automationService := AutomationService{s: s, sharedObject: common.SharedObjectsForServiceSingleton}
//			pb.RegisterAutomationServiceServer(srv, &automationService)
//		},
//	})

// SharedObjectsForServiceSingleton is that Singleton object that allows sharing states
// between services
