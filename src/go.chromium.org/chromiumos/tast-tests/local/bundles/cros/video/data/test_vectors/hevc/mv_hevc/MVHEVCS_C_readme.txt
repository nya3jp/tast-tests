Category: Prediction Structure (2-view)
Sub category: Simulcast
Bitstream: MVHEVCS_C_Sony
Explanation of bitstream features: All slices are coded as I, P or B slices. Only the first picture of each view is coded as IDR picture. Each picture contains only one slice. NumViews is equal to 2. NumDirectRefLayers is always equal to 0, meaning inter-view prediction is disabled. The two views are same spatial resolutions. All NAL units are encapsulated into the byte stream format specified in ITU-T Rec. H.265 | ISO/IEC 23008-2.
