      "message": "Thanks for the reviews. @llin, I tried diffing the entire UI tree after enabling and disabling annotator mode. The cursor doesn\u0027t appear anywhere in the UI tree. Since Tast is built around the UI tree, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to verify that the cursor changes in annotator mode through Tast (unless we add a scuba test and check pixels). The best I can do is verify that the ink canvas appears in the UI tree.",
