      "message": "we have here 4 file system measurements\n\nThis might be too strong part in overall score.\n\nWDYT about idea to use geometric score here before passing to overall geometric score.\n\n\nEven more. I think file_ext4 is more important here and we could pass it to overall computation as is.\n\nFor other three we can compute local geometric score and pass this result to overall computation.\n\nThus we would have 2 flows representing files in overall.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Based on the data from Hearthstone app, I think what you are suggesting makes sense.  I haven\u0027t seen data on other apps, but if your experience suggests the FS usage trend in Hearthstone is representative of a larger population of apps, then it makes sense.\n\nhttp://doc/1dQ-Y6JTZchSQMaNVQSB5fl4wXr5t4q3dt6Ygpra1nJo#heading\u003dh.pyd832zhgv33",
