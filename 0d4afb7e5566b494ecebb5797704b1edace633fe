      "message": "Thanks Jun, I think the same error are there for the other 3 gRPC services. \n\nI was under the impression that I somehow put them into mainline by mistake, and I was hoping to leave them as \"informational\". I also tried the configuration of removing \"group:mainline\" but leaving \"informational\" in place, however it resulted in an error:\n```\n/home/jonfan/chromiumos/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/remote/bundles/cros/ui/automation_service_grpc.go:23: attribute \"informational\" is invalid in current groups\n```\n\nAfter confirming with a couple of team members, I believe the incumbent configuration is the correct configuration for setting tests as information. \nI think, instead of removing them, I will investigate on the 4 GRPC services and try to turn them green.",
