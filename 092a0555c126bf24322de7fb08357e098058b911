      "message": "Yes, Earlier I had added `{\"group:crosbolt\", \"crosbolt_perbuild\"}` to \"Attr: \" field, which led to the test being run on all device. Here, I have moved it to \"ExtraAttr:\", so the tests should only get schedules on group:cellular and once it gets schedules, it should run crosbolt. I hope it makes sense.",
