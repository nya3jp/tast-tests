(see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16qXhkx6tJLBm6S1jj4aGiRa3o2_jOzvr8Ap21Wizvvw/edit?usp\u003dsharing).\n\nBut also, once we have 99% passrate, go ahead and remove the autotest versions from the CQ in the same CL. No need to have both if we trust that the Tast versions are working.",

      "message": "Thanks for the info. I took a look at the failures in stainless and I think most failures are fixed on master so it should converge soon. I\u0027ll wait for the passrate to reach the standard before merging.\n\nOne side question: Does the number in the doc counts only master or include other branches? The total runs number seems to be all branches. Currently, I usually don\u0027t cherry-pick test fixes, if it is considered in the criteria of wificell-cq, I probably should start picking these fixes.",
