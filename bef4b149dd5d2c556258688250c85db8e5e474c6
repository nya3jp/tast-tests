This is done independently of the screensaver rendering, so I don\u0027t see why there\u0027s reason to believe the youtube video will be more reliable for float_on_by vs slideshow with art_gallery?\n\nRegardless of what the test tracker says, the media string has to work for all ambient mode themes (including the slideshow theme with art_gallery). It seems to me we need to investigate the root cause of the flakiness in starting the youtube video.",
