      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how this would fix the root cause though. Ultimately, the problem seems to be that opening and playing the youtube video is flaky. This is done independently of the screensaver rendering, so I don\u0027t see why there\u0027s reason to believe the youtube video will be more reliable for float_on_by vs slideshow with art_gallery?\n\nRegardless of what the test tracker says, the media string has to work for all ambient mode themes (including the slideshow theme with art_gallery). It seems to me we need to investigate the root cause of the flakiness in starting the youtube video.",

      "message": "I\u0027m ultimately OK with either of those, but 1) IMO serves the greater good since it helps both the Youtube team with their test and also helps future test cases that want to play a youtube video without worry about making their own version. If 1) ends up being impractical for whatever reason, we can resort to 2).\n\nI can take this on when I have time, but if you\u0027d like to drive this, by all means, that would be great.",
