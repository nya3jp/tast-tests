Have you tried using `testing.Poll` for `tconn.Eval` (i.e., https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/uiauto/automation.go;l\u003d201?q\u003duiauto%2Fautomation#:~:text\u003d200-,201,-202)? \n\nFixing `apps.InstallPWAForURL` might be a better solution here.",

      "message": "You are right. It looks like only happen on low-end / tablet devices. apps.InstallPWAForURL seems to be a common function but only used for few tests. I am a bit concern on its stability. \n\nWhy not using polling: In the screenshot http://stainless/browse/chromeos-test-logs/test-runner/prod/2022-03-01/4024b6c5-f8f3-4225-a938-847e4036a054/autoserv_test/tast/results/tests/apps.CursiveSmoke/, the installation popup is shown (it is triggered by the apps.InstallPWAForURL API), I am worried retrying in a non-clean environment is not ideal.",
