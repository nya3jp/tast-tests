      "message": "question: where is the better fit? autoupdate bundle or hwsec bundle?\n\nI personally prefer to mov it under hwsec actually, which means we also need to make autoupdatelib a library public to hwsec or other packegs.\n\nAbe-san, if more and more tests from  different feature teams need such a n-to-m autoupdate pattern, do you think my idea makes sense? and does it make sense to do it now?",

      "message": "The problem is autoupdate tests need a special way of running, and can only be run in leased DUT. This is why I kept them in the original group. It might cause confusion if you used autoupdate utils in your tests then discovered it won\u0027t work. But yes, I want tast owner\u0027s input too.",
