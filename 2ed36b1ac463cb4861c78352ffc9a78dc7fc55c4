      "message": "If I read this test correctly, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d need to call SetUpWithURL that ends up opening a new browser under the hood if the test just wants to check that the terminal command line opens a browser.\n\nWhat I think is needed in this line is checking if a browser window with a given url target is opened or not.\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure if this could be implemented with ash.WaitForCondition querying window type and/or window title (if there is no way to check an url through ash APIs)\n\n+Hidehiko, Georg and I talked about generalizing lacros.WaitForLacrosWindow to browser for this purpose.\nShould we revisit this? some CLs abandoned for the reference: https://crrev.com/c/3430743, https://crrev.com/c/3341459",
