      "message": "IIUC currently all tests using this are expecting to launch a new lacros process from clean start, not to connect to a running process. In this case, throwing an error would help avoid making mistakes. \n\nBtw, I think it could be an option whether to throw an error or move on with the running process when needed in a follow-up. For now I don\u0027t think we have that need. WDYT?",
