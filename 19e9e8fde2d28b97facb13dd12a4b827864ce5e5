      "message": "Thanks for this cleanup, Hyung. I rebased my work and indeed it became much easier and clean now to use the SetUpWithNewChrome semantics.\n\nOne issue I\u0027ve noticed though is that I can\u0027t use Rootfs and LacrosPrimary configuration now without explicitly passing \"var\u003dlacrosDeployedBinary\u003d/usr/local/lacros-chrome\". It hangs in lacros.LaunchFromShelf -\u003e ash.LaunchAppFromShelf. Can you check if you\u0027re seeing this problem as well?",

      "message": "Tiago, it\u0027s not reproducible on my end and hard to tell what to look at without any failure log. Can you grab one?\n\nI just synced to HEAD, cherrypicked your CL (https://crrev.com/c/3508772) then ran `tast run lacros.LoginPerf*` with or without -var\u003dlacrosDeployedBinary, but it all passed.\nOne thing that I suspect is did you see --lacros-chrome-path added in /etc/chrome_dev.conf (probably by deploy_chrome)? If that\u0027s the case either -var should be passed in together or simply --lacros-chrome-path could be removed. Otherwise both would conflict and let the test fail to pass this check: http://cs/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/lacros/lacrosfixt/util.go?l\u003d145\nI think we can follow up on this in your CL review.",
