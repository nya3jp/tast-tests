I rebased my work and indeed it became much easier and clean now to use the SetUpWithNewChrome semantics.\n\nOne issue I\u0027ve noticed though is that I can\u0027t use Rootfs and LacrosPrimary configuration now without explicitly passing \"var\u003dlacrosDeployedBinary\u003d/usr/local/lacros-chrome\". It hangs in lacros.LaunchFromShelf -\u003e ash.LaunchAppFromShelf. Can you check if you\u0027re seeing this problem as well?",
