      "message": "unwrapping errors like this is generally a bad idea.  Also, I think it\u0027s confusing to organize this as one polling function called from another.  Consider using a function other than WaitForEvent, since it\u0027s the opposite of what you want here.  You could write a WaitForNoEvents function and have both it and WaitForEvent use a common helper (note: my example helper function name is bad if you can think of better ones)\n\n// common unexported function that\u0027s very similar to WaitForEvent(), but uses an extra boolean to decide whether to continue on zero events or not\nwaitForEventWithOptions(ctx context.Context, timeout time.Duration, eventsExpected bool)\n\n// returns waitForEventWithOptions(..., true)\nWaitForEvent(...)\n\n// returns waitForEventWithOptions(..., false)\nWaitForNoEvents(...)",
