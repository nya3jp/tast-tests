Moreover, when test cannot successfully click and open menu it makes the App button not responsive -\u003e when I manually clicked on the button nothing happened. Other UI element were still okay.\n\nSolutions that worked on my DUT were:\n- simply wait for the button (where interaction starts) multiple times\nOR\n- use hard time.Sleep(10 seconds)\n\nI tried waiting for UI to stabilize but that didn\u0027t prevent the problem from occurring.",
