      "message": "Yea, Garrick added the UDP one and I extended it for TCP, but the drawback is that it\u0027s not easy to start the connection with a different user in go directly, we may need to execute some external binary for that.\n(There seems to be a trick to start another goroutine, bind it to an OS thread, and change the user there. I have tried that by myself and not sure if it is stable.)",
