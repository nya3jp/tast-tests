This is explainable because it is taken from logcat.\n\nHowever for Play Store shown time, there is a big diff. 2-3 seconds is a huge diff. I would expect comparable numbers here.\n\nCould you please verify what is wrong? We should have the same results, regardless go, or py impl.\nThanks\n\nFYI, bot results for 12333\n12333.0.0,10,13988.9190197,15567.2266722,18506.4880848,0,0,1,1576,2154,3671,0,0,0,2059,3160,6205\nThat is the same as I see on my device locally with py version.",
