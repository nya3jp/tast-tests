Jeremy just wrote a good example on how to run tests with servo on a leased DUT manually. Please try.\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/docs/running_tests.md#googlers-only_running-tests-on-a-leased-dut-from-the-lab\n\nThanks.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know if this \"defer\" is valide after line 81. I think it will be better to put each mouse creat/close block to be a function.\n\nSomething like \n\n```\nfunc() {\n\tmouse, err :\u003d input.Mouse(ctx)\n\tif err !\u003d nil {\n\t\ts.Fatal(\"Failed to create a virtual mouse: \", err)\n\t}\n\n\tdefer mouse.Close()\n\n\t// Check that a mouse is detected.\n\tif err :\u003d oobeHelper.IsHidDetectionSearchingForMouse(ctx, oobeConn, tconn); err \u003d\u003d nil {\n\t\ts.Fatal(\"Expected mouse device to be found: \", err)\n\t}\n\n\tif err :\u003d oobeHelper.IsHidDetectionContinueButtonEnabled(ctx, oobeConn); err !\u003d nil {\n\t\ts.Fatal(\"Expected continue button to be enabled: \", err)\n\t}\n\n}()\n```\n\nIn this case, we can ensure mouse is probably close and you don\u0027t need the Close in line 81.\n\nAlso, I think there are a lot duplicate code in HidScreenUsbMouseOnly, but I don\u0027t have a good idea to clean it up. If you figure out something, please try. If not, don\u0027t worry about it in this CL.",
