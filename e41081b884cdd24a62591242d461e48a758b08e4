      "message": "First ax test! So, I spent a long time trying to extend test_fixture.go to allow a non-Google ax router and pcap, but by the end of it, I had commented out all of TestFixture\u0027s code, so I put it in my test raw. I can still go through the effort of cleaning all that up and checking it in, if you think it\u0027d be useful for more than just me. I suspect we\u0027ll have a Google-router that we can ssh into before too long, so it doesn\u0027t seem to be a useful operation.\n\nBut anyway, that\u0027s not the point.  This test simply connects to each of our 4 ax routers in our lab. I need to make a pool label for the ax DUTs before I check this in, but I figured I\u0027d let you guys review it first. Once this gets in, the multi-peer connection validation is soon to follow. \n\n",
