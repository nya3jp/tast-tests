      "message": "Yes, we need to set explicit timeout because the default 2-min timeout is often not enough for even simplest arc.Boot test on slow devices.\n\nI\u0027m not very in favor of introducing ARC-specific default timeout because it makes it harder to tell the actual timeout from the code.\n\nMaybe we can introduce a common constant for timeout, but we should be careful not to end up in timeout.{SHORT,MIDDLE,LONG} which makes no sense at all, as we did in autotest.",
