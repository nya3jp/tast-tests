      "message": "This will affect all of our performance tests, including Chrome performance tests. Some very old platforms will never go below 10-15% CPU usage, decreasing this value will introduce a lot of flakiness on all these platforms.\nInitially this value was a lot lower, but I gradually had to increase it to fix flaky tests. I introduced a mechanism to gradually loosen the threshold to avoid using a single high threshold for all platforms.\nIncreasing the idle timeout will increase runtime for all performance tests but will give them a bit more time to become idle, so I guess that would be OK if it\u0027s important. But if we reduce the max idle percentage, someone will probably just increase that again after having to waste a lot of time on investigating test flakiness.",
