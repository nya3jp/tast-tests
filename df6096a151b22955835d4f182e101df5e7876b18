(Not sure about go formatting actually)\n\nAlso, not to overcomplicate things, but it occurs to me that this is only going to find files and not subdirectories, so e.g. /opt/google/chrome/locales/ (which is a likely cause of size increase) will be omitted.\n\nWe could do something like:\ndu -sk /opt/google/chrome/* | awk \u0027$1 \u003e\u003d 1000\u0027\n\nNot recursive, but that\u0027s probably best anyway.\n\nI\u0027m also not sure whether | will just work in CommandContext or not.",
