      "message": "\"+\" + minFileSize ? (Not sure about go formatting actually)\n\nAlso, not to overcomplicate things, but it occurs to me that this is only going to find files and not subdirectories, so e.g. /opt/google/chrome/locales/ (which is a likely cause of size increase) will be omitted.\n\nWe could do something like:\ndu -sk /opt/google/chrome/* | awk \u0027$1 \u003e\u003d 1000\u0027\n\nNot recursive, but that\u0027s probably best anyway.\n\nI\u0027m also not sure whether | will just work in CommandContext or not.",

      "message": "I think you should add the \u0027-mount\u0027 option, otherwise you\u0027re going to list some files \"twice\" (kind of). \nFor example ARC++ is in a squash file that gets mounted, so you\u0027ll list the squash file, and the content of that squash file. That\u0027s going to confuse people who notice, say, a 3MB increase in /opt/google/containers/android/rootfs/root/system/lib64/libLLVM_android.so, even though the actual increase in size of the rootfs is much smaller since the file is actually compressed in the squashfs.",
