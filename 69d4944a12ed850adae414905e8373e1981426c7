      "message": "It looks like this is responsible for the difference between this test\u0027s power metric and the power test\u0027s package-0 metric. I think allowing CPU scaling is a more realistic scenario for measuring power/dropped frames. This also enables thermal throttling for the first part of the test, but that shouldn\u0027t impact hardware decode.",

      "message": "I based this benchmark setup code on our earlier autotest code which did the same.\n\nI\u0027m really not sure moving this is a good idea:\n- The CPU percentage will be quite useless as a metric, as it will be influenced by scaling.\n- We won\u0027t be able to compare results between two subsequent runs anymore. In one run CPU scaling might kick in, while in a subsequent run this might not happen. This could suddenly cause a jump/decrease in CPU usage, triggering a perf alert while nothing actually changed.\n- We won\u0027t be able to compare results anymore between different tests. e.g. 40% CPU usage for H264 and 60% for VP9 won\u0027t mean anything anymore, as CPU scaling might have kicked in in one case and not the other.\n- The Chrome side video decode/encoder tests also disable CPU scaling, so we won\u0027t be able to compare results between ARC++/ARCVM and Chrome anymore.\n\nakahaung@, acourbot@: What is your opinion?",

      "message": "What exactly is the purpose of the CPU usage metric in the first place? It\u0027s not clear to me how it translates to something meaningful to the product, especially if we\u0027re measuring utilization in an artificial no-scaling situation. Depending on the purpose, maybe there\u0027s something better to measure.\n\nIf we do want to continue to use CPU utilization like this, I don\u0027t know how useful power/frame_drop_percentage are. I guess the measurement can be used to catch regressions, but the absolute values won\u0027t have any correspondence to what users experience.\n\nre: comparing this test\u0027s CPU utilization to the chrome side test\u0027s, does that test also report utilization for 30/60fps rendering? Or utilization for max decoding speed?",
