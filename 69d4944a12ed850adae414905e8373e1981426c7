      "message": "It looks like this is responsible for the difference between this test\u0027s power metric and the power test\u0027s package-0 metric. I think allowing CPU scaling is a more realistic scenario for measuring power/dropped frames. This also enables thermal throttling for the first part of the test, but that shouldn\u0027t impact hardware decode.",

      "message": "I based this benchmark setup code on our earlier autotest code which did the same.\n\nI\u0027m really not sure moving this is a good idea:\n- The CPU percentage will be quite useless as a metric, as it will be influenced by scaling.\n- We won\u0027t be able to compare results between two subsequent runs anymore. In one run CPU scaling might kick in, while in a subsequent run this might not happen. This could suddenly cause a jump/decrease in CPU usage, triggering a perf alert while nothing actually changed.\n- We won\u0027t be able to compare results anymore between different tests. e.g. 40% CPU usage for H264 and 60% for VP9 won\u0027t mean anything anymore, as CPU scaling might have kicked in in one case and not the other.\n- The Chrome side video decode/encoder tests also disable CPU scaling, so we won\u0027t be able to compare results between ARC++/ARCVM and Chrome anymore.\n\nakahaung@, acourbot@: What is your opinion?",
