I\u0027ve used Start to indicate this, I\u0027ve omitted usage of a Run command as I\u0027m expecting this process to be a daemon ran throughout the lifetime of this fixture (i.e. if 5 tests are using this fixture and assuming the all pass, the smbd should be running throughout all 5).\n```\nI strongly recommend against requiring the user to create a goroutine, because you cannot get a return value from a goroutine. Look at your child cl - you call go server.Start(), and don\u0027t check the error it returns.\n```\nDuly noted. I\u0027ve updated such that the Start command will now call the goroutine instead (and therefore check the error). A couple of things I\u0027m trying to achieve here that might be relevant:\n* The logs might be quite large so I want to avoid using DumpLog (in testexec.CommandContext) as it dumps to stdout. This way I can dump to the out directory instead.\n* Despite a SIGTERM being recommended by Samba as the \"graceful\" way to shut the server down, it unfortunately exits with a 137 so I can\u0027t use the DumpLogOnError as it would dump it every time, hence the need for CombinedOutput",
