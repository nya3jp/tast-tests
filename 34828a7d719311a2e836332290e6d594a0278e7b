      "message": "Please check that this code reboots into dev mode when PressEnterAtToNorm is passed in and FWMP is not, so that we don\u0027t get a false positive. I.e. We are in dev mode, dev mode is allowed by policy, and PressEnterAtToNorm is passed in. Do we end up in dev mode? That is what we would want to happen.\n\nOne way to be more certain, would be to press Ctrl-D a few times, and then switch to ENTER. Then we should be in dev mode if allowed, but fall back to normal if not allowed.",

      "message": "Below is what I saw if we\u0027re in dev mode using fixture, dev mode was allowed (FWMP unset), and PressEnterAtToNorm was passed in:\n\nAt reboot, DUT would display the \"You\u0027re in developer mode\" screen with two options: \"Return to Secure Mode\"/\"Boot from internal disk\". \n\nBy default, the second option is usually highlighted, and as a result, pressing ENTER would boot DUT into {developer mode, from internal device, signature verified kernel key}. \n\nBut, I agree that moving this section and appending it after pressing Ctrl-D would fit better with the overall logic of this test.\n\nThanks for the suggestion!",
