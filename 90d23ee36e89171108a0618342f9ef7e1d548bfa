      "message": "That makes sense.\nIn my opinion, only reason to check the ARC-side state is to make it easier to isolate a problem when ARC state and ash state are different. I guess that kind of situation should\u0027t happen by design (especially for ARC-R+), but anything can happen in our world so checking ARC-side state is somewhat beneficial in practice comparing its cost.\n\nBut I can also understand and agree your suggestion: This is an end-to-end test so why do we test internal state... hmm...",
