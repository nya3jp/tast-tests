But I uploaded it with a new date anyway so it\u0027s much easier to clean up the old files. Otherwise, for each file we need to find the latest date, which might be different.

And while the binaries are different, the things being tested, the test methodology and results are very similar. I see this more like \"improving the current test\", then \"adding a new test\". The \"new\" suffix is just a temporary measure so we can test the improvements side-by-side for a few weeks before switching.\n\nI would rather deal with the limitations you listed above, for 4 testcases, than have 40 future testcases with an additional \u0027Binary\u0027 in the name.
