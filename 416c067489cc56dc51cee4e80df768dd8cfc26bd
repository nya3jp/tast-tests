      "message": "It is just an opinion. I don\u0027t know UI test enough to say it is right or wrong. From my experience, tests with an assumption of a particular orders of icons of pinned apps are prone to failures. There are a lot of possible causes such as different UI for different models, UI changes, ... \n\nTherefore, I suggest not to assume a particular order. Just make sure they exist.",

      "message": "Thanks for the comment! For this particular test, we do want to check the order of the apps. The order is also set at the beginning of the test.\nAs for this utility function, it would be easier and cleaner to write by having the above preconditions to determine the results of the orders. This should work fine as I don\u0027t think there will be a new subtest that don\u0027t follow the preconditions. If not, I would have to list all the array order one by one as the previous patch.\nTagging tbarzic@ for a second opinion. Thanks!",

      "message": "I think the order of apps after pinning/unpinning is a reasonable thing to validate in this test. Especially after dragging app icons. I don\u0027t think this cl adds any extra assumptions on default order of pinned apps, and it didn\u0027t seem to be an issue. We could potentially relax assumption on order of Files and Settings app, but I\u0027d suggest doing this if we start seeing issues with the test.",
