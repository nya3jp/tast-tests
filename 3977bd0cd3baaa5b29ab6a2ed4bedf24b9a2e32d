      "message": "I remember it was preferred to have separate tests if we want to cover both cases of HW variants in the CQ/CI tests. Otherwise test scheduler (in infra) may get satisfied by assigning the test to just one DUT in the future. Has it been changed by F20--\u003eCFT change?",

I didn\u0027t know that a test scheduler might work in that way.\n\nAs I have updated the CL description, Assistant hotkey is not the main part of a test case except `assistant.Hotkey`. For `assistant.Hotkey`, I have reverted my change and added a comment about why we have a parameterized version.",

      "message": "LGTM! Actually I am not sure if current schedulers always minimize DUT reduncancy like the way I described above, however, still, a random (seemingly unrelated) change of the board subsets to run tests can potentially cause similar situation. So I think it is good to expose such test difference as parameterized tests. The usage of hwdep information in other tests looks the right thing.",
