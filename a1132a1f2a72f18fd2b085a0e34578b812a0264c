Was that namespace correctly removed ? Jie can confirm what the teardown process should do but normally I would not expect that interface to still be around so there might be some other error going on there.\n\nFor instance if you create a netns and add a veth pair across the current netns and that netns:\n  ip netns add bar\n  ip link add foo_left0 type veth peer foo_right0 netns bar\n  ip link show foo_left0\n    31: foo_left0@if2: ...\nthen deleting the netns deletes the interface in the current netns as well:\n  ip netns delete bar\n  ip link show foo_left0\n    Device \"foo_left0\" does not exist.",
