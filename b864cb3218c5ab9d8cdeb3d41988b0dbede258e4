      "message": "Initially I thought this would affect later tests if they share the same fixture, but it seems that the next test run cancels all ongoing activities before running. We still should stop the activity as it\u0027s annoying to have the test leave demanding processes running.\n\nIf stopping the activity fails this shouldn\u0027t have any affect, so we don\u0027t want to fail the test in the lab if this happens. I\u0027ve only seen this happen once on my local device, so I can\u0027t reproduce this consistently to investigate further. If I see this happen more often I\u0027ll investigate more, maybe I can supplement this with a force kill, but for now this seems unnecessary.",
