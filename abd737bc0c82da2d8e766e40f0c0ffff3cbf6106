      "message": "\u003e It is important to have this check for ChromeOS.\n\nThe check is still enforced in ChromeOS.  It moves to code below.\n\nHowever, for a ChromiumOS without Chromium specific kernel patches, \"SECURITY_CHROMIUMOS\" isn\u0027t there.  After applying the patch, the code checks the config if and only if the device is ChromeOS.\n\n\u003e please feel free to setup meeting with me\n\nI will re-phrase the wordings.  Let\u0027s have a meeting if there is still misunderstanding.",

If so, the test is doing what it is supposed to do, right? Look like what you do right now is to hide the bug. I would suggest to add a software dependency on the kernal version to disable the test in certain patches.",
