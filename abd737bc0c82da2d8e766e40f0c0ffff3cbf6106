After applying the patch, the code checks the config if and only if the device is ChromeOS.\n\n\u003e please feel free to setup meeting with me\n\nI will re-phrase the wordings.

If so, the test is doing what it is supposed to do, right? Look like what you do right now is to hide the bug. I would suggest to add a software dependency on the kernal version to disable the test in certain patches.",
