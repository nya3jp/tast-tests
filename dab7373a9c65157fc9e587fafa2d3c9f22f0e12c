      "message": "We can update waitForChromeProcesses directly, but conceptually this looks closer to what we want.\n\nThe diff can be observed in a following case: chrome processes are not running, but crashpad_handler processes are.\n\nwaitForChromeProcesses is waiting for Chrome to run here, so I do not think we want to return in the case.\nThough, practically it is very exceptional case, and anyways GetRootPID called below would return an error, so that overall this function behavior will be just reporting error anyways.\nWDYT?",

I just worried that it\u0027s out of scope from your original motivation and it can just increase the chance of your changes rolled back for test breakage. I would keep the behavior as-is, leaving a TODO for the original author to clean up... but it\u0027s up to you.",
