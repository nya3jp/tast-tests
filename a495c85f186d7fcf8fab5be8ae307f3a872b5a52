I don\u0027t think these use cases for avoiding lacros deployed binary var make sense or are good.\n\n2. If we have an api (particularly one that looks more like the default one you should use) that allows avoiding lacros deployed binary var, then we will get a bunch of tests added that don\u0027t respect the var. That\u0027s going to eventually cause failures on chromium infra eventually, which will be hard to debug\n\n",
