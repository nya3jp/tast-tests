      "message": "We should not do this IMO.\n\n1. We should provide the minimum api surface to get stuff done. I don\u0027t think these use cases for avoiding lacros deployed binary var make sense or are good.\n\n2. If we have an api (particularly one that looks more like the default one you should use) that allows avoiding lacros deployed binary var, then we will get a bunch of tests added that don\u0027t respect the var. That\u0027s going to eventually cause failures on chromium infra eventually, which will be hard to debug\n\n",

      "message": "Please provide a counterargument to my concerns in #1 or #2 if we want to merge this.\n\nTo expand on #1. the idea here is that we want to take into account the vars. It\u0027s kind of an implementation detail that it happens to be only lacros deployed binary. So, I don\u0027t think it makes sense to avoid passing in the testing state just because it\u0027s more convenient, or the tests don\u0027t need it.  \n\nhidehiko@, wdyt?",

This could be an answer to 1. \n2 could probably be addressed by tast-owners\u0027 review rather than an enforcement at the api level. Aside, browser/OS will anyway need to take a separate process in place to review automation coverage between browser/OS on a regular basis, which is also helpful here.\n\nKeeping it open for hidehiko\u0027s feedback.",
