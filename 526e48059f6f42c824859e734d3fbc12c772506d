      "message": "Just wondering if there isn\u0027t an easier way to build/deploy the test apk. For each change to the tests we need to build a new apk, upload it, and create a separate CL to use the updated apk in our Tast tests.\n\nWhile working on our Chrome decoder tests I was submitting changes almost every other day. In the future I would like to work on improving the video encoder/decoder tests on ARC too, but this might be a lot more work with an approach like this. Can\u0027t we build and deploy the apks as part of the test image?",

      "message": "For testing/development purposes, the APK can just be copied to src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/video/data/c2_e2e_test_\u003carch\u003e.apk and tast will use that instead of the .external one. For actual deployment of the tests, I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t looked into it, and I don\u0027t know enough about the integration of the Android and ChromeOS builds to comment on how it would work.",

I have not messed with it at all yet, but here is a presentation that talks about a new solution(starts on slide 35): https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10dT8ilJxn-JCSfGRh3kmmXLnsgY2np8tWZNd4rMOtak/edit#slide\u003did.g6d0b9ae105_0_497\n\nAlso, here is a CL that uses the new solution: https://crrev.com/c/2004451\n\nHopefully this fixes your issues, if not now, in the long term.",
