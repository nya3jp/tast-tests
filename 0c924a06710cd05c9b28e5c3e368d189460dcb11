We didn\u0027t notice that this temp sensor was broken for a while and I wonder if we had a tast test for it we could record and look at thermal zones over time and fail if something is way out of whack like zero degrees C or really hot.",

      "message": "I came to the same conclusion last week. It would be better to only look at CPU thermals, but I don\u0027t know how non-ARM boards setup their thermal zones. On Trogdor we have many thermal zones that don\u0027t correspond to the CPUs, so this list could become quite long.",
