      "message": "To change the policy source you need to pass in another Chrome flag (--device-management-url).  I think it makes sense to have that case as an option through policyMode since the url and fetch flags are not independent.  (I.e. there\u0027s no reason to pass in a management url without also fetching policies)\n\nHappy to leave this as a bool for now if that makes things cleaner.",
