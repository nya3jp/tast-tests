I want to get feedback on the use of the UIAuto library and UI parts before I send it to tast-reviewers.\n\nThe test clicks on the bluetooth button in the quick settings menu repeatedly and confirm that 1) The UI button changes states and 2) the bluetooth adapter is powered on/off.\n\nRegards\nShijin ",
