      "message": "This was moved from shillscript.go, so I\u0027m not sure the history of the original review. Somehow I messed up my stack of patches and removed this function in the patch on top of this. (On this note, I think it would make sense for a single tast-owner to review a stack of related patches, but the bot doesn\u0027t seem to do this. Is that intentional?)\n\nI\u0027ll fix that issue up to start.\n\nBut to this comment, I guess this could be rewritten as `msg :\u003d v.String()[1:]`. Since this CL is just moving code around, I can give this a shot as a new change on top of this stack.",
