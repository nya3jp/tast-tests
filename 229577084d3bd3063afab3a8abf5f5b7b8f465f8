      "message": "I took a look and it seems the extension isn\u0027t being installed even when we do not have a proxy. So the problem has to be in the ExtensionInstallForceList policy itself.\nHowever the policy also does not report any errors and is correctly listed under chrome://policy\n\nI took a look at the policy.ExtensionInstallForceList tast test and that test uses actually a real managed account force_installed_tast_user@managedchrome.com which has the ExtensionInstallForceList configured in DPanel. So my guess is that there is some general problem with extensions when using the fake login, but I don\u0027t know what exactly the problem could be.",
