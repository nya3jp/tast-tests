      "message": "This is interesting, usually roaming is used to refer to intra-SSID handoffs between APs. In those cases, wpa_supplicant would see that the two APs were on the same network and use things such as RSSI, SNR, and estimated throughput to decide whether or not we roam. In this \"roaming\" case, it seems like we don\u0027t expect any handoffs to occur, i.e. even if we were right next to an AP with better credentials and with better signal, we won\u0027t move if we\u0027re already connected (correct me if my understanding is wrong). Can you clarify this difference in the comment?",
