      "message": "My understanding is that the old test worked this way also, but at some point we added usb_a_port_count to the configs so that we could detect the situation where one of the USBn_ENABLE pins was omitted from the EC binary.\n\nSo you should change this to:\n\n1) Only do this loop if h.Config.USBEnablePins is empty.\n2) If usb_a_port_count \u003c 0, run the code as you have it.\n3) If usb_a_port_count \u003e 0, and USBn_ENABLE doesn\u0027t work, then fail. Because we expected the port to exist, but it does not.",
