      "message": "nit: This sets initialV4Role to curr before updating through SetString. I guess sometimes curr could equal to value.  That looks a bit redundant.\n\nFor now, initialV4Role is used to reset upon Close(), so I think that doesn\u0027t matter much and you\u0027re aware of that, but ideally, I guess it might be slightly better to set initialV4Role after SetString succeeds.  I think this is fine though.",
