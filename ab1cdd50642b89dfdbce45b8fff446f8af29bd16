      "message": "Mind taking another look? Found some flakiness on fast boards such as \"eve\" that we are tapping the button too early before its fade-in animation finishes. When that happens, the tap is ignored and we fail to change fullscreen state. The fade-in animation is 250ms, added a 500ms to be on the safe side.",

      "message": "We are waiting for the video control bar to show up. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a good way to wait. The button is there with non-zero opacity and ui.WaitUntilExist thinks it is there. The opacity animation is on its parent \u003cdiv\u003e. And the button is not clickable/tappable until the animation finishes. I did not dig hard on why.",
