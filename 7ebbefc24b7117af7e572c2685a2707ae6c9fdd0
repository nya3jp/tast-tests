      "message": "This is very similar to ShillCellularSuspendResumeEnabled (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3291420/)\n\nI think this might be better have a single test and use parameters for enabled and disabled, e.g. see src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/network/dns_proxy.go. That way if we run into any flakiness we can fix it for both cases.",
