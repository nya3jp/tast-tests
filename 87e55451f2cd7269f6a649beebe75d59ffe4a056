      "message": "I like the idea to generate updated expectations! It seems a little brittle/cumbersome to generate locally though, because there are quite a lot of models/boards/chipsets, and this puts burden on the person updating to have them on hand, or lease them all.\n\nI think Ilja has some thoughts too on alternatives, in particular, outsourcing some of this work to the lab.",

      "message": "I absolutely love that you are trying to automate updating expectations. We need that.\n\nOne problem is that we can\u0027t expect from the guard to pick an exotic device, flash it with an image, sync and build the chroot, run it locally for a few hours etc. just to get the expectations.\n\nThe expectations have to flow from the lab runs.\nThere are two possibilities:\n1) Query stainless or similar like Andres is doing, or Testmon.\n2) Try to aggregate on the DUT in the lab for all tests and report it to GS at the end.\n\n2) is aggregate for a few tests (like all VP9) on a single DUT. It might be possible to do in Tast.\n1) is across all lab devices for some specified builds. Obviously cleaner, but can\u0027t be done in Tast.",
