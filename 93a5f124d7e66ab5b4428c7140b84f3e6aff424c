      "message": "do you really get much value out of the separated \"config\" representation? It has only 1 option, but then the only way to use it (NewServer) has many more.\n\nRelated: I wonder about the Server type: it has NewServer(), start() (non-public) and Stop() -- I\u0027m thinking it might be clearer to have Start() be public, so the caller can do the \"create\" separate from the \"start\" -- this might get more complex depending on how we want to bridging.",
