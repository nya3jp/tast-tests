      "message": "Hmm... In general, I prefer keeping things in named files, rather than moving many stuff to util,\nbecause util can contain whatever conveniently, so it can quickly turn into kitchen sink.\n\nMore details:\n- conn.go: this is on border to me. I think we can keep the file, but I do not have strong opinion to merge it into chrome.go.\n- extensions.go: I\u0027d recommend to keep it. And, instead, move ExtensionBackgroundPageURL to the file.\n- I\u0027d prefer keeping SaveTraceToFile closer to {Start,Stop}Tracing. I would introduce trace.go, or another package.\n\nWDYT?",

Actually I\u0027m fine with most of your recommendations, so let me do so.\n\nBut move of SafveTraceToFile was requested by Jun:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2639194/1..7/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/chrome.go#b1461\n\nJun, if you still want to move it elsewhere please discuss with Hidehiko. I\u0027m fine with either way.",
