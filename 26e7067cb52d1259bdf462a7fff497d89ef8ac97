If you check all rest boards, it is pretty stable there too https://tastboard.corp.google.com/test/apps.LaunchHelpAppOnManagedDevice.logged_in_unstable.\n\nSince our app is not really board matter. I think it is ready to be promoted. But it is fine, if you are not comfident with it, I can remove this test at the moment. WDYT",
