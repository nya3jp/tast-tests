      "message": "It looks like this method does a bit more than it should. There is a D-Bus method with the same name, so looks like this method should call this function only once.\n\nAlso, what if I want to test that some service is not found (it\u0027s a part of API)? This method will hangs until timeout...\n\nI understand that the problem is that you need to wait a bit to get available service. But we probably must find another way to know when shill manager has this service. Can we subscribe on D-Bus signals / monitor when service D-Bus object will appear?",
