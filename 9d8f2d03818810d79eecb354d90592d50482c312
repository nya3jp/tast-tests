      "message": "I see your point. This is not an intended behavior. I\u0027m quite sure that it is a bug. I looked into the source code (http://b/208658574#comment1), but I cannot come up with a fix.\n\nThe purpose of this Tast test is not for testing this kind of issues. This test is solely for identifying/confirming the error logs in the net.log file. We will actually delete or downgrade these error logs (http://b/208516275) while keeping this test green. So I think the filename truncation should be addressed separately instead of using this test for monitoring the bug and verifying the fix.",
