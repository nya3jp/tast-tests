      "message": "Thanks you guys for the helpful suggestion. I think we would like to keep cpu.WaitUntilIdle() for now, as I finally reproduced the failure locally.\n\nThe previous test audio.Microphone will reset the device to login screen, and for some unknown reason the device is super busy at login screen. I think that\u0027s a bug and I will forward it to the performance team. The recorded flame graph at login screen: https://pprof.corp.google.com/user-profile?id\u003d2316611961c95d4387dbb49adeec1786\u0026tab\u003dflame\n\nI guess I failed to reproduce yesterday because I already logged in to the device and running camera.HAL3*  will not reset the device back to the login screen.",
