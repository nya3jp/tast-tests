      "message": "From chat:Denis Brockus, 1:11 PM\nIf I were running GGB flags with software sync enabled and then loaded EC-RO to test a change I would want to be able to set no_ec_sync to make that bit set while running the test, even if GBB flags were not set that way to begin with.\n\nA test that does not care about software sync may need to know which EC it is running.  This flag gives that ability.  I have seen testing where a change to EC-RO was made and flashed, and then the test went through and verified the EC-RW was not changed/fixed and the problem continued. This flag gives a way to help make this clear",

When all the tests are in TAST, this won\u0027t be true, but this will solve your immediate problem, and punts on the long term problems with tests that actually care if ec sync is enabled or not.",

      "message": "I think no ec software sync makes sense and abstracts what that means in terms of implementation, whether it is GBB 0x200 or what ever it is at the time.  The tests are allowed to do what ever they want with the flags and this gives the choice to the caller to decide what that one bit should do. There is output in the log that indicates it is up to the caller to restore the GBB flags back to what they want them to be.\n\nThis is not just an if the test is actually testing software sync or not. It is more that you want the EC-RO to run instead of jumping to EC-RW. This allows for faster builds and tests the new changes in EC-RO",
