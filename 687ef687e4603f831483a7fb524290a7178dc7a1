      "message": "In this case, the buffer might not yet be flushed. Several possible combination:\n1. either Signal sent after cmd exited: no harm but leaving some logs.\n2. SIGKILL after SIGTERM: might not be able to flush buffer if cleanup is not yet done.\n3. SIGTERM after SIGKILL: I guess the process will just end as usual SIGKILL.\n\nIn any case, as SIGKILL is only sent after the hard deadline is already reached or after we already get the event, I guess it is OK to just SIGKILL and report error/nil.",
