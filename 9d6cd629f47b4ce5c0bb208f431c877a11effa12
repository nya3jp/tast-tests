      "message": "So I don\u0027t know if it was a hard requirement to write all the decompression code in vanilla Golang...\n\nFor this CL this code lacked the correct application of permissions, i.e., it created all files as root, which made it impossible for Chrome to work with /home/chronos/. While it could be possible to fix the code here accordingly, I just thought - why don\u0027t we just call \"tar\" that already implements all this.",

      "message": "Originally, the tast-test owner pefer not to depend on command line in general, so I write the compress/decompress with `archive/tar` package. Ideally, we should use archive/tar to handle compression, but we need to take care of many things (such as permissions, owners and selinux attributes) since the archive/tar only implement the fundamental part. I actually support to use `tar` command now, as long as the tast owner is okay with that.\n\nIf we are going to use command line `tar`, would you like to also change the compression part?",
