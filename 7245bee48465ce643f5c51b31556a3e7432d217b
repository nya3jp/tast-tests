I believe it is at least mostly the same.\n\nEither those methods should be used (I think they need slight modification to reopen) or it should potentially be extracted to chrome/ui/systemtray and then shared by this and quicksettings. I think quicksettings is likely the correct home though. Adding Kyle incase he has any comments.",

If there\u0027s a general need to always update the system tray, the Show function could be modified to reopen it, or an alternative function could be added to hide and reopen it for use cases that require it.",
