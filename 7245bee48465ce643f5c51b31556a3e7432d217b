I believe it is at least mostly the same.\n\nEither those methods should be used (I think they need slight modification to reopen) or it should potentially be extracted to chrome/ui/systemtray and then shared by this and quicksettings. I think quicksettings is likely the correct home though. Adding Kyle incase he has any comments.",
