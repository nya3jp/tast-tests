      "message": "This CL has a long (partially WIP) history. I recall Arowa was working through several flakiness bugs, some of which I made educated guesses at (e.g., using wpa_supplicant instead of iw), some were since fixed, somewhere in the revision history. Can I get a summary of those somewhere? Were they fundamental issues, or just relatively small things (e.g., typos, or do X before Y)?",

The test was still failing to roam. \n\nThe changes I did were changing the order in the function DiscoverBSSID() to check the BSSID first then run scan if it doesn\u0027t match. Also, fixing the bug in PS11 (returning nil at the end of the poll). These changes fixed the error in the logs:\nhttps://paste.googleplex.com/6551316149043200\n\nI ran this final patch on a rammus DUT for 50 times with no failure.",
