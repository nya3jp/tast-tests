There is nothing in the xmlrpc API that says these are constant.\n\nWhat the users should do is call GetSupported{Ports,Inputs,Outputs} to get a list of allowed ids, then GetConnectorType, HasAudioSupport, HasVideoSupport on each of them.\n\nI make no guarantees that for chameleon v3 these IDs are stable or correct, in fact it\u0027s already wrong due to `PortID \u003d 3` being a second HDMI port..",
