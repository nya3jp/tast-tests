      "message": "Hi,\n\nThis CL adds a bluetooth UI test which tests that the toggle button on teh bluetooth quick setting page works. It is similar to https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2893546 but tests a different part of the UI. This UI didn\u0027t have UI elements to wait on after a state change, so I have to poll for change of power state of the Bluetooth adapter.\n\nRegards\nShijin",
