      "message": "Didn\u0027t know about \"-var keepCache\u003dtrue\", thanks for the info! Apologies for the slow reply, was OOO for a few weeks.\n\nI prefer to also have a variable to control the behavior from inside the tests to have a bit more control, rather than keeping the full cache. It\u0027s only a small change anyway, and some tests have more than one configuration option (e.g. to download the encoded video after a test run for debugging purposes).",
