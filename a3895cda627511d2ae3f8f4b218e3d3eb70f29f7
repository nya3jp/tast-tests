So if the watcher succeeds, but enabled did not actually change, we repeat until wCtx times out.\n\nIn cellular_helper.go, I just use testing.Poll to wait for the state to change, which is a bit simpler, but maybe slightly less optimal in the success case, since the watcher would succeed as soon as the change event was fired?\n\nI don\u0027t feel strongly either way, but eventually we should converge on a single pattern, and we should probably put the logic in manager.go. I\u0027ll try to put together a cleanup CL for that, but we don\u0027t need to block this on that.",
