If it\u0027s not in split screen and doc window is not activated somehow, RoleTypeTextField won\u0027t be visible and ui.FindWithTimeout(ctx, tconn, ui.FindParams{Name: \"Document content\", Role: ui.RoleTypeTextField}, timeout) would fail; if it\u0027s in split screen, as long as the RoleTypeTextField is visible it\u0027s fine.",
