      "message": "Hmm..., this looks like what interfaceNames in udev_rename.go is also doing. I\u0027m not sure if:\n1. it\u0027s better to use built-in net package. (udev_rename was originally \"ls /sys/class/net\" but later modified to use net package)\n2. it\u0027s good to extract them into, like, tast/local/network.",

      "message": "Use net.Interfaces() to get net interface names.\n\nNow we have code duplicate between shill/wifi.go and bundles/cros/network/udev_rename.go. As placing interfaceNames() is shill package for udev_rename to use is inappropriate and it is small/trivial enough, I would prefer having the duplicate for now.\n\nThe correct way could be: move InterfaceNames() and WiFiInterface() to bundles/cros/network/util.go as they are currently used in network tests. But I prefer not moving GetWifiInterface() in this CL.",
