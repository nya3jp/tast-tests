      "message": "this test will only pass when run on real hardware (as opposed to a VM), right? just as a heads-up, i have an open task to figure out how dependencies will work in tast -- see http://doc/133fqdEFbUZ6g0IhHFtPQOvl2YHFJg1_QBne8p3rTgz8\n\nthe betty-release builder currently runs \"bvt\" tests, so we may want to add a way to filter VM tests out on it. if you add a \"vm\" attribute to this list, then i could make it skip those (although that runs the risk of confusing people into thinking that these are tests that are supposed to run on a VM, rather than tests that exercise VMs and thus need to run on real hardware...)",
