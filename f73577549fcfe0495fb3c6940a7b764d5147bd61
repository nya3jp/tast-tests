      "message": "# I think the order of the check comes from the original test, but...\n\nThis function checks;\n- ro dir, by tryWrite\n- UID/GID and permission check.\n- rw dir, by tryWrite.\n\nHow reordering them to put ro/rw dir check closer? E.g.\n\nfor dir, mode :\u003d range ... {\n}\n\ntryWrite :\u003d function(...) {\n  ...\n}\n\nfor _, dir :\u003d ... {\n  // ro dir check\n}\n\nfor _, dir :\u003d ... {\n  // rw dir check\n}\n\n(optional): As you\u0027re splitting the test into several pieces, how about split this into two, since tryWrite check and file permission check looks independent...?",
