The reven-vmtest board does not have an informational tast builder, but amd64-generic does:\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/p/chromeos/builders/vmtest/amd64-generic-tast-vm-informational\n\nIf we look at the most recent run, we can see the test was successfully skipped:\n```\n2022-08-03T04:33:35.273539Z Started test platform.FlexID\n2022-08-03T04:33:35.277826Z Skipped test platform.FlexID due to missing dependencies: missing SoftwareDeps: flex_id\n```\nI looked back 20 builds and that precedes the merge of http://crrev.com/c/3781253, which is the CL that added the test.\n\nUnless we add a new informational builder for reven-vmtest, the -direct-tast-vm builds associated with this CL are the best we can do to verify that the promotion will not create widespread breakage.\n\nIf merging this CL causes breakage, the sheriff will revert it. Shall we wait until amd64-generic-tast-vm-informational runs (and skips) the test 20 times? It may take several more days for that to happen.",

We used to have one but we removed it because we never looked at the output and it was fairly expensive to run, as many tests time out or fail.\n\nI created b/241370114 to consider adding an informational builder back for reven-vmtest. The style (recipes-based) has changed since we last had an informational builder (legacy), so perhaps having one will not be as disruptive as it used to be.\n\nW.r.t. passing CQ for this CL, it will be submitted without bypassing CQ: I will verify that both the reven-vmtest tast builder (and any other tast-running builders) behave as expected as well.",
