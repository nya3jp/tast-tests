      "message": "Some previous refactoring must have lost this. It was used to distinguish the 1st and 2nd test cases below for example. Those two weren\u0027t meant to just differ in terms of stable vs unstable boards. They were mainly meant to use tablet vs a11y VK because the impls are different between the two. As of now, the two test cases look exactly the same; the only difference is the board. You can read the comment essays attached to the test cases for more details.",

As we discussed long time back, the precondition is built to align with most real user scenarios. \n\nTablet VK is the default VK in Tablet testing, while A11y VK is the default VK in clamshell mode. \n\nWhich means, if we use precondition pre.VKEnabledClamshell, it is A11y VK.\n\nhttp://cs/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/inputs/pre/pre.go?l\u003d229",

      "message": "I think you haven\u0027t quite got what I meant. Test cases #1 and #2 look exactly the same now, except for stable vs unstable models right? They both have pre.VKEnabledClamshell (i.e. a11y VK). However, they were originally meant to test on tablet vs a11y VKs. You can check comments attached to the test cases for more info. This is a drive-by kinda unrelated to the current refactoring and deflake effort here, but I think it\u0027s an important issue to traceback and fix. We might\u0027ve lost test coverage at some point because of this.",

In the initial test you added https://crrev.com/c/2380901/11/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/inputs/virtual_keyboard_dead_keys.go, there were 2 tests verifying FR on A11y VK and CA on tablet VK.
