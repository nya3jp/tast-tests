      "message": "This flow still seems a bit weird (e.g. wait for turn on, then alert gone, then turn on again?), and the conditionals make it hard to follow since it\u0027s not longer a linear chain.\n\nClick until the Remove confirmation is gone then wait for us to have a turn on button seems fine. Simpler, and it\u0027s all in the \"remove linux\" `uiauto.Combine` so hopefully it\u0027s still clear from logs where the error is if it fails.",
