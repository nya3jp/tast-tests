      "message": "So what is the suggestion here? These failures make any test that depend on having Android running fail. Are you marking all of those tests as informational as well? It doesn\u0027t appear to be the case.\n\nPlease advice what the path forward here is for failures that this test has no ability to control for. Because the alternative is to make this test trivially pass when Android doesn\u0027t boot, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what we want to do.",

It appears I was wrong about the policy, and it\u0027s fine to have tests that fail occasionally because of the fixture.\n\nHowever, it\u0027s consistently failing on brya-kernelnext. Can you please split it into an informational and critical test, with the brya-kernelnext remaining as informational and all the other boards promoted to critical.",
