      "message": "Please don\u0027t disable screendiff here. If you really don\u0027t want the test to fail, instead of defer d.DieOnFailedDiffs, write (with the same TODO):\n```\ndefer func() {\n  if err :\u003d d.GetFailedDiffs(); err !\u003d nil {\n    s.Log(\"screen diffs failed: \", err)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat being said, I don\u0027t agree with stopping the test from failing due to screen diffs. It\u0027s an informational test because it\u0027s not stable - there\u0027s no need to remove the thing that allows us to see how stable it is / isn\u0027t.\n\nI\u0027m happy to take over stabilizing this test with ACUITI if you want - I\u0027d like to try out ACUITI, and I don\u0027t actually have much work for the next day or two.",
