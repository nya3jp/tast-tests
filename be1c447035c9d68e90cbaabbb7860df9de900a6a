I didn\u0027t realize CHROMEOS_RELEASE_APPID on -kernelnext boards are different from base boards and are invalid on the update server. The test should be skipped on those boards.\n\nI tested this CL on a lab octopus-kernelnext device and confirmed that it\u0027s skipped. Please take a look. Thanks!",
