Rather than having only the common functionality in the base and each specific derivation containing the specializations.\n\nI\u0027m just worried that if we have 5 more tests like this that each contain n branches for each app that all the app specific logic will spread all through the common functionality. Vs having all the base functionality together, and all the individual specializations for each app also grouped together.",
