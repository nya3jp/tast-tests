      "message": "Thanks, let me research a bit on exiting the server more gracefully. \n\nThe current SSH-based Stdin/StdOut seems to have go routine to handle termination after capturing the exit signal, although that signal is based on client side closing the grpc communication channel if I remember correctly. Maybe similar termination routine can be used even when the exit signal is different. I will study up on that.\n\nI will explore the route of a \"Terminate\" API as a GRPC service API. My first reaction was that the GRPC server could be breaking the current encapsulation if grpc server knows about the `cros` server and has the power to terminate it, but obviously my judgement could be biased as i worked mostly with user services.",
