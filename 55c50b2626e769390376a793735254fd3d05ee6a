In the last 20 builds, all failures are failure to connect to Chrome browser or Android failing to boot which is unrelated to the test or scenario being tested.

      "message": "I get that they are failures that don\u0027t seem particularly related to the test\nhowever, you are not sharing a fixture with any existing tests\nso this is effectively introducing a new independent source of flakiness to the CQ which can be expected to fail a number of new CLs that wouldn\u0027t have failed before.\nIt is also quite commonly over the 60 second test execution guideline from go/tast-add-test\n\nIt is possible this is acceptable (especially if the failures are not in fact independant of the other arc tests - ie. they all pass and fail together), but I don\u0027t think I should make the call here.\n\nAdding Seewai to decide.",

      "message": "Experimental boards (kernelnext) are unstable and fail frequently. Preventing CQ promotion of tests due to them will make it hard for us to promote tests. \n\nWe have had multiple P0s where a tast test didn\u0027t catch the issue because it was marked informational.\n\nI think we only need to consider boards that block CQ.\n\nThe worst case impact of this promotion is that the test turns out to be flaky (which there isn\u0027t evidence for) and it is demoted again. The worst cast impact of not promoting this test is shipping regressions to the customers. \n\nI think test is stable on stable boards and the container version is already promoted to CQ so I recommend we go ahead.",
