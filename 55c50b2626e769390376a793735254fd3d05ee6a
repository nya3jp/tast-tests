In the last 20 builds, all failures are failure to connect to Chrome browser or Android failing to boot which is unrelated to the test or scenario being tested. These are platform failures that are reflected in other Critical tests as well.\n\nCan you please check again?",

      "message": "I get that they are failures that don\u0027t seem particularly related to the test\nhowever, you are not sharing a fixture with any existing tests\nso this is effectively introducing a new independent source of flakiness to the CQ which can be expected to fail a number of new CLs that wouldn\u0027t have failed before.\nIt is also quite commonly over the 60 second test execution guideline from go/tast-add-test\n\nIt is possible this is acceptable (especially if the failures are not in fact independant of the other arc tests - ie. they all pass and fail together), but I don\u0027t think I should make the call here.\n\nAdding Seewai to decide.",
