      "message": "Is there a way to wait for page switching by testing.Poll, instead?\ntesting.Sleep is often a source of flakiness. This looks not the regression so I don\u0027t think it is a hard blocker of this change, but as you\u0027re making the change here, I think it should be worth considered. WDYT?",

      "message": "I\u0027ve double-checked but the implementation of the button does not indicate any changes, and unfortunately it is very hard to use testing.Poll for now. I filed crbug.com/1059051 for that.\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:ash/app_list/views/page_switcher.cc;l\u003d67?originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F\n\nNote that it emits an accessibility event on selected status change, however, it is very hard to capture this asynchronous event (addEventListener is a method to AutomationNode, asynchronous call and wait for that wouldn\u0027t be written cleanly in Tast, I think).\n\nThat\u0027s unfortunate. I added a comment here for the record.",
