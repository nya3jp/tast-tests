      "message": "\u003e the info is there, but buried under compression\n\nAh, thanks for the pointer. I took a look at the pcap and there actually is an MBO-OCE IE in the first probe request, but the device sends a second one pretty soon after with a botched MBO-OCE IE (all the bytes are the same, except the first two bytes of the OUI are wrong - 0x9c699a instead of 0x506f9a). I\u0027m guessing this is some weird kernel/firmware race or something.\n\nI\u0027ll probably just push this in for now since it seems like it doesn\u0027t really occur that often, but I\u0027ll file a bug if it happens again.",
