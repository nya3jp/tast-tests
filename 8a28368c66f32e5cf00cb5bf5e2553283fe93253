      "message": "Sorry to jerk you around too many times on this (I already suggested a rename earlier), but when thinking of packet-capture (and any other uses of the term \"Interface\") I\u0027m still not sure this is quite the right name. Especially with pcap, we may have other Interfaces (specifically, monitor-mode) on the same Router, and I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be reusing this \"handle\" for that. So it\u0027s still important to include the \"AP\" name in here.\n\nIn the interest of shortness, maybe you don\u0027t need both Interface and Handle? I guess any combination of\n(a) AP\n(b) Interface or Iface\n(c) Handle\n\nNominations, in no particular order:\nAP\nAPIface\nAPHandle\nAPIfaceHandle\nAPInterfaceHandle",

      "message": "kinda feels like this could be part of the iw package, maybe as a NetDev function. I know that\u0027s not currently how iw/runner.go is currently structured, but it really does look like there\u0027s a lot of operations in there that might be cleaner as NetDev functions.\n\nI\u0027ll leave that up to you; we can refactor later anyway, and it doesn\u0027t need to block this review.",

      "message": "Hmm, I feel like this is much more complicated than it needs to be. I don\u0027t believe we need to do *any* reuse of a busy phy, at least not in AP mode. We always expect to be creating at most 1 AP per phy (basically, 1 2GHz and 1 5GHz).\n\nIf we integrate monitor mode into this phy selection, we\u0027d want a separate parameter to consider: type. It\u0027s fair to have 1 AP and 1 monitor, but not 2 monitors (I don\u0027t think? or at least there\u0027s no reason to) and not 2 APs.\n\nDo you think the current structure really helps to add monitor support later? As I see it, we can start much smaller for now.",
