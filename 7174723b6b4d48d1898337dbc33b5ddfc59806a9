My chromebook seems to be very fast and good (which makes it bad to find issues and bugs...), so even tests passed on my device they might still fail on many other devices. ui.MeetCUJ.base_case and ui.MeetCUJ.worst_case both passed and performed as expected, in both tablet and clamshell mode.\n\nThank you so much!!
