IMHO it\u0027s best to check this before submitting the print job to avoid flakiness.\n\nAlso job history is separate feature from the user POV as it has dedicated UI. Do you think that it\u0027s perhaps better to have a separate test suite for History? You could also then check that it does contain a print job once it is completed.",

      "message": "True, makes sense. For this particular test, the job will never succeed, since there is no real printer (not even a virtual one).\n\nI think the best path forward for this CL would be to remove `printManagementApp.VerifyNoHistoryLabel()` entirely. The entire flow of print job history is already tested by non-policy printer tests anyways. WDYT?",
