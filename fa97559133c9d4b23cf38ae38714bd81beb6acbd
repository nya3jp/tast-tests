      "message": "Why do you update specifically policy/gen.go and camerabox/gen.go, but do not make similar change to other packages under src/chromiumos/tast/services/cros? The camerabox package kinda makes sense since it contains common.proto and is causing the namespace conflicts, although I would expect to an update to another package that also contains common.proto. The policy package does not seem to contain such file, so it\u0027s unclear why it\u0027s updated.",
