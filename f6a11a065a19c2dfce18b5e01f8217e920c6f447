I was thinking that this known error and other errors would appear as a separate tests, or at least distinguishable by a query when querying the logs.\nOne of my concerns is that, in general, if we check in a test that expects the exact wrong output, then, when the main logic is fixed, this test is going to break detecting it. It might be confusing for developers.",
