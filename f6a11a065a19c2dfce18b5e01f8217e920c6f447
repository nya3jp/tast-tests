      "message": "After off-thread discussion, I got that:\n- The test tests several things serially.\n- The code being tested by this test is ARC, not Android.\n- Some other assertions (expectation verification) cannot run unless this part of the test go through.\n- The test result is watched manullay in the dashboard.\n\nI approve this as a tentative fix, but I recommend to:\n- write TODO comment to make sure not to promote this test to critical before the bug is fixed. (uin place of label:informational)\n, and also suggest to:\n- check if there are Fatal() that could be replaced with Error(), so that other parts can continue regardless of TTS text check\n- splitting test to smaller tests\n",

      "message": "What do you mean by \"can\u0027t check other breakage\"? I was thinking that this known error and other errors would appear as a separate tests, or at least distinguishable by a query when querying the logs.\nOne of my concerns is that, in general, if we check in a test that expects the exact wrong output, then, when the main logic is fixed, this test is going to break detecting it. It might be confusing for developers.",
