      "message": "Hi Everybody:\n\nI just uploaded another patch to reduce random failures of the time. I still cannot remove the sleep statement. If I remove it, it almost guarantees running clamshell mode on a tablet would fail. I have tried to wrote new functions to wait for other kinds of events such as EventTypeActivedescendantchanged and EventTypeTreeChanged. Unfortunately, they were not as reliable as sleep. \n\nThe I have tested this patch with dru (3 consecutive successful runs), kodama (3 consecutive successful runs), octopus and hana. I still could see failure on kodama once a while but it was not common.\n\nPlease let me know if it is sufficient.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai",
