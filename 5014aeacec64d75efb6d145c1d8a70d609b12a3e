      "message": "CrosToPhoneInContacts tests still failed locally, but may as well update the snippet and see how things go in the lab.\n\nBased on my local test runs, I suspect the CrosToPhoneInContacts failures are due to a contacts/certificates issue. If I manually toggle the visibility setting from allcontacts-\u003ehidden-\u003eallcontacts, the tests will pass for a while on my local setup. Need to investigate more, I\u0027ll also add a topic about it for the weekly sync on Wednesday.",
