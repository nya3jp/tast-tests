      "message": "The term \"native bridge\" is a technical term. Native bridge is designed and developed to support ARC, so it sounds like a target of COIL. I\u0027m ok to rename, as long as they agreed to rename \"builtin bridge\" sometime soon rather than other terms.\nDefer to Lev.\n\n(optional): maybe nice to have a tracking issue for this specific case, and make it a blocker for fixing \"native\" term, because it is not closed within Tast.",

      "message": "Thanks. To me, this sounds like the external dependency?\n\nLaurent, considering the recent discussion via code review,\nis it possible to add entries of proper nouns / project names etc. containing words considered as offensive to the spreadsheet, and come up with the consensus of the replacement with entire teams?\nE.g., \"master mount\", \"slave mount\", \"keymaster\", \"native bridge\", \"native app\", ... maybe more. There should be \"exact one term/phrase\" replacement, and it should be used consistently wherever.\nIf so, could you drive the discussion, and if so this can be left TODO?",
