      "message": "When we are calling NewFirmwareTest and biod is disabled (biod.conf is missing) then stopDeamons() function will fail because it can\u0027t get information about biod.\n\nI think NewFirmwareTest is the only function which disables biod. This was intended to fix situation in which biod service remains disabled because error occurred in NewFirmwareTest (after biod was disabled, eg. incorrect write protect flags) or user interrupted test (Close() method not called).\n\nFor the first case I created https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3159538. It implements enabling biod service and FP updater when NewFirmwareTest is returning error. It doesn\u0027t help with situation in which user terminates test manually.",
