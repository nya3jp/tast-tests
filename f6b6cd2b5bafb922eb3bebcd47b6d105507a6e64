      "message": "Could you add more documents?\n- how this list is made / should be maintained?\n- What is the clear definition of this list?\n- In general it is not encouraged to use Models/SkipOnModels with exceptions.\n  E.g., one of the typical expected use cases is test is failing on some specific\n  model, but the reason is unknown. We\u0027d like to exclude it from CQ, but would\n  like to keep others while investigation. Or something.\n  Do you have some similar situation, like above? Or ... something else?",

      "message": "Hi Hidehiko,\n\nThanks for your comment! I added a comment to that list.\n\nWe are targeting only allowlisted OEMs and models for Telemetry Extension due to privacy reasons. Eventually all device models of allowlisted OEMs should appear in this list.\n\nMaybe if it will be possible, we can just have list of OEMs instead?\n\nUnfortunately, I think we should keep such list of models to be able to promote our tests to the CQ.",
