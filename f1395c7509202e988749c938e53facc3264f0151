Unfortunately Tast does not support multiple failure statuses at the moment (like how autotest has warning/test_na/not_run/etc.), so I think the best option is probably to fail with a distinct error message here to easily separate it from other failure modes. Not a big deal though so I\u0027ll leave it up to you",

More generally we have other platform tests that depend on setup of external components whose failures in tests are reported as errors but are not really errors as far as actionability goes. What should we do with that ? As you said we would have ideally a separate return status like \"setup error\" or \"environment error\".",
