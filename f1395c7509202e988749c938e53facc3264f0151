      "message": "I\u0027m a bit skeptical of changing this to Logf, since it sort of hides the problem in the logs and the reported error on stainless/tastboard/etc. might not reveal the actual point of failure as clearly.\n\nLooks like from the comments, the idea here was to avoid failing this test for non-ARC related reasons right? Unfortunately Tast does not support multiple failure statuses at the moment (like how autotest has warning/test_na/not_run/etc.), so I think the best option is probably to fail with a distinct error message here to easily separate it from other failure modes. Not a big deal though so I\u0027ll leave it up to you",
