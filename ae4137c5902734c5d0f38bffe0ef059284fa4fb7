      "message": "Please note that this is slightly different from what CL description says (and what patchset 1 does), \nI think this is fine but it might be worthwhile to update the CL description accordingly.\nPreviously: each iteration of testing.Poll had 10 second timeout. Poll does not have the timeout\nPatchset1: each iteration has 30 second timeout\nPatchset2: each iteration has no timeout, the entire Polling has 30 seconds timeout\n\nShuo-Peng will make the approve as he\u0027s assigned as the owner.\n\nI guess the most of the duration/latency comes from the cat of the file through ssh -- eventually it may be worthwhile to add a gRPC server to conduct this checking on the device. That way it should be much faster.",
