      "message": "The current mechanism of profiler package only allows to save a single file.  And personally, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s great to split perf data into multiple files -- rather, I think it\u0027s better to focus only on the part where we want to collect the profile.\n\nSo what do we care?  Is it only for the conference session?  Then maybe it should be done slightly later.",
