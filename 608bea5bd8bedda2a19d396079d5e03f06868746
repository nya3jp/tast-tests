As long as the metrics themselves are correctly collected, our CUJs should properly record them if they are in this file.\n\nA couple example CUJs would be ui.MeetCUJ.2p (for mouse data) and ui.MeetCUJ.4p_present_notes_split (for key press data)\n\nNot sure a good test for touch.",

Currently, none of the new metrics cover regular mouse movement.\n\n#2 had `EventLatency.KeyPressed.TotalLatency`, `EventLatency.MousePressed.TotalLatency`, which is correct since we click once and type for a few minutes.\n\n#3 has `EventLatency.KeyPressed.TotalLatency`, `EventLatency.MouseWheel.TotalLatency`. I think this partially makes sense too, since we scroll a Google Sheet with our keyboard \u0026 scroll wheel. This test also scrolls down with the trackpad, but I don\u0027t see any scroll metrics being registered for that. \n\nThus, I don\u0027t think we have CUJs to really verify the gestures, and we might want to create a bug to see how we can get gesture scroll data for GoogleSheetsCUJ. Otherwise everything looks good.\n\nLast thing: would it be possible to add `EventLatency.GestureScrollUpdate.Wheel.TotalLatency`? That way after this CL, we can explore the trackpad scrolling in Google Sheets with gestures latency.",
