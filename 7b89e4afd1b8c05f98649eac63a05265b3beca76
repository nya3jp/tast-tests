I reviewed the \"openwrt Bridge, Veth, and VethBridgeBinding support\" cl first (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3651555) , so my comments regarding modifying these common files are on that cl. If you think it makes sense, feel free to bubble down those changes to this initial refactor. Otherwise I\u0027m fine with landing this cl as is provided everything is submitted at once.",
