      "message": "nit: I\u0027ll leave this up to your discretion but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a benefit in introducing this `u` variable rather than returning immediately in each case. The rest of the block reads as a `Run a command and leave` but these two cases (User, and Chrome) deviate from that which was slightly confusing as a reader. It adds slight duplication but I think it might flow better.",
