      "message": "Hi Sam. I just checked the Tastboard for the test\u0027s results.\nAsh flavor has a passrate \u003e 99% https://tastboard.corp.google.com/test/policy.BrowserLabsEnabled\nwith all the issues that are opened as known and related to Chrome process or hardware problems.\n\nLacros flavor had some issues from 05.10 - 12.10 but since it is stable. The one, recent issue is related to OOBE - framework not passing through it.\n\nAccording to the go/cros-pci dashboard this test does not have Browser test coverage. Do we still want to remove it?",

I don\u0027t usually work on Tast at all so I didn\u0027t know how to interpret any of the stats (and didn\u0027t realise that some issues are known issues). I\u0027ll keep the test for now and will revisit in case there are any issues in the future.",
