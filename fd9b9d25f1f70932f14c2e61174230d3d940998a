      "message": "Yes and no: |legacy_video_decoder| is \u003d\u003d |disable_cros_video_decoder|,\nwhich is added to the overlay of platforms/boards where the new VD is\nnot working for some reason -- those platforms _only_ support the \nlegacy VDA and don\u0027t support the new direct VD.\n\nBut we want to run _alt versions on platforms where the new direct \nVD is enabled because until now, we were based on the assumption \nthat wherever the direct VD is enabled, there\u0027s a legacy VDA. That\nassumptions holds everywhere until Trogdor:\n\n                                      VD  VDA\n  disable_cros_video_decoder\u003d\u003dtrue    no  yes\n  disable_cros_video_decoder\u003d\u003dfalse  yes  yes\n  Trogdor                            yes   no\n\n(IOW if we were to use |legacy_video_decoder| as Sw precondition for \nthe _alt tests, we would not run them on e.g. Intel platforms, where \nwe have a legacy VDA that we want to maintain, and a direct VD.)\n\nSo we\u0027ll still need a new flag to define that a given platform has\nno legacy VDA to fall back to. So PS1 way of adding a new flag was \nthe way to go, although with the current naming it\u0027d be a bit \nconfusing, perhaps we can consolidate the current [1]: \n\n \"cros_video_decoder\":      \"!disable_cros_video_decoder\",\n \"legacy_video_decoder\":    \"disable_cros_video_decoder\",\n\ninto:\n  \n \"video_decoder_direct_and_legacy\":   \"!disable_cros_video_decoder\",\n \"video_decoder_legacy_only\":         \"disable_cros_video_decoder\",\n \"video_decoder_legacy_supported\":    \"!board:trogdor\",\n\nAnd then add \"video_decoder_legacy_supported\" to all the _alt tests.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/master:src/platform/tast/src/chromiumos/tast/cmd/local_test_runner/main.go?q\u003ddisable_cros_video_decoder%20main.go",
