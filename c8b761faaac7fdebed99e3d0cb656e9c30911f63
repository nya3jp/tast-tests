      "message": "Hi Alex,\n\nThis is the second part of this test that adds pre-provisioning using curl and deprovisioning with tape. After this I\u0027ll just need to figure out one more step with device resetting and it should be done.\n\nI\u0027m having some issues getting the yaml file needed for this CL. For some reason I can no longer repo upload to the private repo, will need to figure this out. \n\nAlso have one question for you in a comment below.\nThank you!",

So in order to do that what you\u0027d need to do is create a new struct that contains gaiaenrollment.TestParams and deviceDetails or one that just contains the entries of both in a flat structure.\nI think adding the latter to the gaiaenrollment helper is probably the nicer way, so you could add this:\n\n// ZTETestParams is a helper struct to keep parameters for ZTE gaia enrollment tests.\ntype ZTETestParams struct {\n\tDMServer string // device management server url\n\tPoolID   string // poolID for the used test account\n\tSerialNumber         string\n\tHardwareModel        string\n\tDeviceProvisionToken string\n\tCustomerID           string\n\tBatchKey             string\n}\n\nhere: https://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/remote/gaiaenrollment/helper.go",
