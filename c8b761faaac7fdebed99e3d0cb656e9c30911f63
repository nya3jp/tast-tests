      "message": "Hi Alex,\n\nThis is the second part of this test that adds pre-provisioning using curl and deprovisioning with tape. After this I\u0027ll just need to figure out one more step with device resetting and it should be done.\n\nI\u0027m having some issues getting the yaml file needed for this CL. For some reason I can no longer repo upload to the private repo, will need to figure this out. \n\nAlso have one question for you in a comment below.\nThank you!",
