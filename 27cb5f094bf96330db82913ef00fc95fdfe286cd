      "message": "Ah sorry, that\u0027s for encoding. But still, would using all cores make the DUT feel unresponsive? The decode time improvement is good in some cases but not a game-changer, perhaps the test should use a scaled version of the same test file? I.e. use a single 640x480 input file, decode, then upscale?",

I am fine to abandon for the concerns.\n\nI couldn\u0027t guess how well your proposal goes.\nMy concerns are \n* the resulted video quality due to upscale, and \n* speed of decode+upscale,\nthough it obviously saves disk usage on DUT.",
