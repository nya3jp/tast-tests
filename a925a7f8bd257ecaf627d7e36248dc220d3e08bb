      "message": "Did we have code to change window state to normal? Maybe we should do that before dragging.\n\nI did a quick look at the failures, most of the screenshots show maximized browser windows. That seems like to be the cause of the failed 2nd drag. W We are not dragging the tabs but selecting the text.\n\nThe strange failure is \"nocturne\". Window frame does not have the usual min/max/close buttons, which might imply that we are not in a clamshell mode that we expect (not sure what that mode is). Maybe ash.EnsureTabletModeEnabled does not work as expected with latest chrome. We could fix that separately if it persists.",
