      "message": "I understand the concerns of causing fragmentation. But I am not sure what needs to be done for this comment.\n\nThis `DisableFieldTrialConfig` defaults to false. I added it so that sheriff/gardener/test owner could use it to temporarily to turn off finch test config for investigations.\n\nI used it to for a few inputs.* test that I could not figure out why they fail. I filed bugs for further investigations from owners. Without this, I would have to mark these tests `informational` (about 17). Do you prefer that?",
