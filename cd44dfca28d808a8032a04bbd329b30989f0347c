In case it doesn\u0027t, it will then search on a predefined slice with the required complete paths. Currently constrained to zork-vilboz just for proof of concept. But it is not a long-term approach. \n\nInternal attempts to list files from google storage were successful on a public bucket. In order to implement it and test it on \u0027chromeos-image-archive\u0027, we will required some additional permissions on \u0027chromeos-bot\u0027 project.
