      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is a very nice general property. Particularly the part about \"if it has been removed\", since...if we haven\u0027t removed it, then this function suddenly has a very different guarantee.\n\nIf you want to modify this at all, I think it should just wait until D-Bus is ready (e.g., wait for the Manager service). That would also implicitly get you the property of \"profile is initialized\", I believe, which is what you really wanted for CL:1763617 and similar.",
