      "message": "1. ui service is in running state, so it\u0027s not a correct check point.\n2. `modetest` is the standard command line tool to query/interact with display, but it has same behavior. Besides, there is really a case that no CRTC info exist. So we can\u0027t rely on its output to determine whether the initialization is done or not.\n\nAs I said, both outputs are correct, we reflect the real information.\n\nLet me add graphics team members to see if there is any other approach.",

      "message": "Does the case where no CRTC exists happen in this test? I guess this test runs on headless chromebooks so it would (?).\n\nIn any case, polling on CRTC info for 10 seconds (and not counting it as an error if nothing appears) or so is strictly better than an unconditional sleep. Or, you can try to detect if there is no internal display (there is code that does this in Tast iirc).",

I also did a small experiment (http://b/225766968#comment10), it just needs a few seconds for initialization.
