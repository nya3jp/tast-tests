      "message": "Do we have to hard code the number of scrolls and then do a sequential search? It does not generalize to all situation and looks very inefficient. Will it works if we use Descendants in ui/automation.go (or something similar) to find the object and bring it to focus? \n\nIf we have to use scroll, you still can use Descendants to find the number of entries, right?",
