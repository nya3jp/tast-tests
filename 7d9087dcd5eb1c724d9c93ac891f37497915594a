      "message": "Hi Victor, I will take a look. I\u0027ve also filed http://b/255972416 regarding this `skipToLoginForTesting` for some other flow. \n\nI wonder if we should replace these `*forTesting` \u0027shortcuts\u0027 with something that would resemble the actual flow on the device more genuinely, since these are end to end tests. Currently, they go directly into the browser and change things there, but maybe they should just keep the actions within the frontend to mimic the real flow. What do you think?",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is the right place to put it though. Tests call chrome.New to get Chrome to a state they want, without caring about how to get there. Maybe it makes more sense to add a separate test that follows the user flow more closely.\n\nI also suspect that more UI interaction will break the tests every time we make a change since nobody notices the tests are broken until the Chrome uprev. Normal GAIA login is part of the CQ, so there\u0027s hope for the enrollment user flow to also be there.",

      "message": "I was thinking of implementing this step in Chrome itself, similar to what the OOBE Test API does for some screens. It could then provide a guarantee that calling \u0027skipToLoginForTesting\u0027 would do all the required actions to bring the user to the login page. We could have a similar \u0027skipToEnrollmentForTesting\u0027 method guaranteeing that you would end up on the enrollment page. \n\nIf we could guarantee this flow via some proper browser tests on the chrome side, we would be able to prevent such breakages, right?
