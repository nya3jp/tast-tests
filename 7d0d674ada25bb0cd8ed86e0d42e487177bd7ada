      "message": "I think we should return the error, as a failed HealthCheck call indicates a need for a router reboot.\n\n```\n// HealthCheck examines if the DUT is healthy. If some tests fail to bring\n// the WiFi device back, it treats the DUT as unhealthy. Testing host needs\n// to reboot the DUT to refrain it from affecting the following tests.\n```\n\nIf this is called during Reset it will cause Reset to fail and then the test lifecycle actions will trigger a reboot.\n\nIf this is called from within a test we can\u0027t fix it and it should cause a test failure. Then after the test Reset is called, calling this function again likely resulting in another failure that can be recovered from before moving onto the next test.",
