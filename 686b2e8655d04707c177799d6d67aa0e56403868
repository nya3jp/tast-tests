The assumption is that the background video is not repeatedly played.\nWhat do you think about the workaround? The good side is that it can save the 10 seconds sleep for general good case.",

      "message": "After thinking twice, I think we should avoid this workaround even temporarily. TestPlay function has 15 callers today, so this workaround can waste up to 2.5 minutes.\n\nRegarding your workaround: it\u0027s almost the same as retrying the whole test (although it\u0027s quicker). Retrying a test to \"suppress\" flakiness is usually a bad idea: it makes it even more difficult to find the root cause.\n\nAnyway, thanks for filing a bug, let us discuss there.",
