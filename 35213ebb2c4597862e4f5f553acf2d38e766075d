      "message": "so, the original test just ignored failures due to conflict, and you\u0027re choosing to poll instead?\n\nSeems like we should tell Shill to stop managing the device instead. Otherwise, you really have no guarantee the your \u0027iw\u0027-based scan will ever succeed.\n\n(BTW, I don\u0027t like this pattern in general, of having both Shill and iw operating on the device. It\u0027s the source of all sorts of flake.)",

      "message": "minor note: Autotest will just fail here. (i.e. outside Poll) I guess retry for this case is more friendly for non-lab open air environments. But the meaning of the test might be slightly different. (original: one single scan finished in timeout \u0026\u0026 ssid scaned in this scan; now: ssid scaned in timeout)\n\nThe bug of the test does not say much about the motivation: crbug.com/344050, so this looks good to me.",
