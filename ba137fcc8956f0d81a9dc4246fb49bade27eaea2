      "message": "\u003e I was surprised there was no common implementation\n\nThis happens always in Tast :-).\nOur approach is to minimize the scope of common library, to reduce the maintenance complexity.\nLessons we learned from autotests is that having more common libraries looks indeed convenient, but the function can be stale in many situations. Cleaning up such function is not easy/simple tasks, than adding the one into common library.\nIf there\u0027re use cases, we\u0027re happy to having them under common place, but otherwise, we highly encourage to keep such utilities in a local place (under subdirectory of the test category directory), even if it looks pretty generic.\n\nIn this case, maybe under tast/local/power, but to promote this function from per category utility to generic utility, I have couple questions/requests/comments.",
