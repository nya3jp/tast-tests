Functions are local to the package (i.e. files in the same directory), and in this case, that is fine.\n\nPreviously internal function should be preferred since it is a part of a test case -- functions can be shared with other test cases in the same directory and conflicting names would bother test authors.  With new package, that wouldn\u0027t be the case.",
