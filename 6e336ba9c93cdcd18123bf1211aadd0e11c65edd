I haven\u0027t had time to take another pass at this, but it looks like this test is failing consistently on devices with 2 built-in ethernet.\n\nOur ARC implementation could only have at most 2 eth devices, so the additional eth device added by this test on devices with 2 eth will fail.\n\nWe\u0027d probably need to fix this before promoting.",
