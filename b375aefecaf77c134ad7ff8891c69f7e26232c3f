      "message": "I added some more commentary as David requested above.\n\nAbove, I turned off Tethering only in the case where we want to test connecting using the notification. The first step in the test is to connect with Instant Tether and step through all onboarding flows on CrOS and Android while all networks are connected (this is necessary due to the ADB-over-wifi setup used in the lab).\n\nIf we want to test the notification, we need to trigger it by not being connected to any networks. To that end I disconnect from the Tethered hotspot, the box\u0027s WiFi AP, and disable the ethernet adapter. This should prompt the \"Wi-Fi available via phone\" notification, which we will use to reconnect Instant Tether in `connectUsingNotification`, and then test that the tethered connection works while no other networks are active.",
