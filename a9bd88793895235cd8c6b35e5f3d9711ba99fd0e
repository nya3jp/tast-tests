      "message": "This line and the |s.Log(msg)| line above are quite useful when debugging locally, such as using with gdb. I personally used it a lot, and would prefer to keep the executed command in log/logfile with a copy-paste friendly format if possible.\n\nNote that we might run the same gtest binary with different extra args multiple times in a single Tast test, like camera.HAL3*. Without these lines, it\u0027s also hard to identify them from the log.",
