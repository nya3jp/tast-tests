      "message": "That\u0027s a good point that I wanted to confirm with you.\n\nMajor skew may be able to catch an edge case like this: https://crbug.com/1258214 in which stateful has not been updated for a couple major milestones so getting out of skew. For now \"skew_1major\" is a positive test that checks -1 milestone skew is allowed, then more skews (2major) could be added as a negative test to catch the issue above.\n\nBy the slow uprev did you mean that Lacros and OS/Ash may not be compatible sometimes (mostly when a new branch is cut). Ideally that should not be happening once lacros uprev is automated. There is an ongoing effort to make this happen in Q4. In this context, Ash/Lacros milestone gap would be considered a bug not a flake.",
