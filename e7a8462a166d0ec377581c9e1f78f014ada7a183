      "message": "\u003e wait for a condition or something that tells you that the audio device is ready.\nThe only way AFAIK is to open the device, which introduces another unknown delay before the device is available.\nAlso the tests that need this fixture are using a fairly bare bones command line utility, which does not have built-in retry and we cannot easily distinguish temporary errors from permanent errors with its output. I think adding retry logic in tast for that command instead of using this fixture would make both the test code and test output harder to digest.\n\nTBH, I think if we have perfect drivers and service managers we shouldn\u0027t even need to sleep at all. b/232799132 which required 11s sleep was actually a (low priority) bug.",
