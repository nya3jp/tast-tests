      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is particularly robust. If we use *any* other SSD or TBT device with downstream USB port other than \"Samsung_X5\", this test will fail.\n\nInstead I would recommend the following to determine the directory:\n- Before plugging in the TBT device, list the directories in /media/removable.\n- Plug in TBT device.\n- List directories in /media/removable again. There should be just 1 new directory, and that can be your destination dir.\n\nThis will at least let us use other device than just the \"Samsung_x5\". Also, you can then remove this field from the .json file.",
