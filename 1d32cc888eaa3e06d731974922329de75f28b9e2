      "message": "In this case it doesn\u0027t matter because this JS file doesn\u0027t have direct\ncalls to methods below; IOW JS parser parses as it ingests, so as long\nas the JS files are only function definitions without forward dependencies\nthere should be no problem. This is a somewhat normal JS circumstance as\nlibraries tend to depend on each other and sometimes that relationship\ntree cannot be flattened.\n\nOTOH if any of these JS would immediately call some of these then-undefined \nfunctions (or instantiate objects etc) then we\u0027d have an issue, but the \ncr.NewConn in l.52 of peer_connection.go will then fail.",
