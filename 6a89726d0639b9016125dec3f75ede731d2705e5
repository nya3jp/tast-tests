That increases my concerning actually, because it has risk to mix router\u0027s index and dut\u0027s index.\n\nI still recommend you to use object/struct and reorganize API, which I believe is reasonable amount of work fit in this CL\u0027s scope, and there\u0027s no blocker to do so.\nIf you strongly would like to keep the index-ish approach and postpone the fix, could you introduce a new type as an \"ID\" to represent DUT instance, in order not to mix index for the routers etc, for short term, at least?",
