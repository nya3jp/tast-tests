      "message": "Is there no visible way (as in, shill API/state machine, or similar) to determine when roaming is \"complete\", then? I noticed that Hsin-chen is having to repeat similar polling patterns in CL:2380898, and that seems kind of unfortunate -- maybe we don\u0027t care for every test, but at some point, we *do* care that connectivity is relatively seamless -- for instance, that we don\u0027t have connectivity \"hiccups\" after we thought we were finished. Polling leaves more gaps, where we can\u0027t really tell if we\u0027re having flaky connectivity along the way.\n\nI\u0027m mostly asking for consistency sake (so my reviews on other CLs match the expected behaviors we\u0027re testing for in tests like RoamDbus), not necessarily to block this particular change. But if this is indeed a problem, maybe this is deserving of some future changes.",

      "message": "ATM I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a good way to determine when roaming is \"complete\". I suggested earlier (hidden somewhere in the comments of this this CL I think) that we could add a new DBus property somewhere that accomplishes this. We could also add a new state that is considered an Online state, but indicates that we\u0027re renewing DHCP after a roam. Or, we could emit a PropertyChanged signal for Online -\u003e Online service state change, but that\u0027s a little hacky.\n\nOpen to other ideas as well.",

Oops.\n\nIf we\u0027re just staying Online (or, Connected in this test case), that actually seems to be a bit of a lie, as we really are going through \"configuring\" at a minimum (we have to reestablish layer 3 connectivity, even if this is usually a trivial renewal). I understand the practical reasons why we don\u0027t do that right now, as that might cause needless disruption. But it does seem like it could be possible to reflect Service states accurately without actually tearing everything down -- not sure.\n\nAnyway, thanks, I guess we stick with polling post-roam for now.",
