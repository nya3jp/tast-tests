      "message": "Thanks for uploading this.\n\nAs the tests stand, they require too much manual intervention to get the DUT in a state to run these tests.\n\nBefore we add any more tests, we really need to automated the deployment of the existing TQC agent packages. Here are the steps I recommend:\n- The contents of tqc_20.x.x.tgz should be put into an ebuild (it can be private ebuild if necessary)\n- The ./install_ftdi.sh and ./install_mongodb.sh can probably be added as part of the above ebuild (although I\u0027m not sure of the details).\n- Add a package in tast to intialize the Mux agent (`initctl start tqc` etc).\n\nAttempting to automate the above will be benefical for both Intel as well as Google in running these tests faster.",
