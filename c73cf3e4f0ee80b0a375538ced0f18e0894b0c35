      "message": "Ack about defer to reset.\n\nThe dot has different colors in light/dark modes, didn\u0027t notice this until yesterday evening when leased device automatically switched to dark mode ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\n\nDo we want to add subtests for that? It feels like that this is responsibility / unrelated implementation detail of the AshColorProvider -\u003e cros_styles to return the correct value of `kIconColorProminent`. But at the same time, this test probably is the perfect place to test integration between all these components. Not sure about recommendations here.",
