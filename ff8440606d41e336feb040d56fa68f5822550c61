      "message": "Let me make sure I\u0027m understanding correctly. The problem here is that the PersistenceBluetoothSansWifi leaves the DUT in a state with the wrong MAR settings, which is causing a different test to fail, correct? Have we documented any investigation as to why the MAR settings are being set incorrectly? I\u0027m hesitant to push through a workaround like this if we\u0027re papering over an actual platform issue.",
