      "message": "Let me make sure I\u0027m understanding correctly. The problem here is that the PersistenceBluetoothSansWifi leaves the DUT in a state with the wrong MAR settings, which is causing a different test to fail, correct? Have we documented any investigation as to why the MAR settings are being set incorrectly? I\u0027m hesitant to push through a workaround like this if we\u0027re papering over an actual platform issue.",

If it\u0027s really an unexpected condition where MAR gets disabled, we want to fix the underlying condition rather than workaround it",
