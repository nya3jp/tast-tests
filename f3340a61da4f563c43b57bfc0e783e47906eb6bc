      "message": "Sorry, I\u0027m still puzzled by the computation here. Did you run this test with hidpi devices like eve/nocturne/atlas/etc?\n\nI assume that the android app provides a black square of 100x100DP, and you\u0027re trying to calculate the number of physical pixels in the screenshot. Is that correct?\n\n* I assume that a square in Arc app should appear as a square, it would be 100x100 DP in ChromeOS / Ash world\n* when the display is hidpi, there would be multiple physical pixels for a single DP, thus some ratio needs to be used for the computations. However, I\u0027m afraid that the current code computes a different ratio -- the aspect ratio of the display\n* I guess you might want to use display.Info\u0027s display_zoom_factor * display.DisplayMode.device_scale_factor.\n\nWith those of my thoughts, I am afraid that the current code doesn\u0027t compute the correct number of pixels. Please let me know if you tested on various devices and this actually works fine.",
