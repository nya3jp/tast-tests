      "message": "I am finding that this part works if I run only video.ChromePIPEnergyAndPower.tablet_big_h264_hw_alt, but not if I run video.ChromePIPEnergyAndPower.* and wait for video.ChromePIPEnergyAndPower.tablet_big_h264_hw_alt. In the latter case, the resizing swipe moves the PIP window instead of resizing it. When making this observation, I change the one-minute sleep (near the end of the test) to one second, so that I can sit and watch several subtests in a reasonable enough amount of time.\n\nI am puzzled. Please advise.",
