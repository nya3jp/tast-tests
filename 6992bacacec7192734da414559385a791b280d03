      "message": "I think that command line is good to replace the code to generate du_stateful.txt, let me do that.\n\nAs for statfs code, I have two reasons. One reason is that there are several mountpoints under /mnt/stateful_partition so it is difficult to tell the real \"used\" size per filesystem from the output of du. The other reason is that, while debugging some failures, I saw a case where encrypted.block allocated size was a lot larger than total size of /mnt/stateful_partition/encrypted. I guess it was caused by large files in the directory created and then removed. Unfortunately we can\u0027t observe this by simple \"du\" command.",
