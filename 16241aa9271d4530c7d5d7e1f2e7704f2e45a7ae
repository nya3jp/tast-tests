This should probably be /storage/emulated/0 to make it consistent with a comment in the function body.\nAlso, \"mounts the external storage /sdcard/emulated/0 on the host at [...]\" sounds a little bit confusing to me as /storage/emulated/0 is on the guest side.\nMaybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m weak at English prepositions, but \"mounts Android\u0027s external storage directory /storage/emulated/0 on the host\u0027s [...]\" or something like that might be easier to parse.",
