      "message": "My intention was that it is indirectly verified by the fact that setup difference between crash.Sender and crash.SenderPaused is just sender.Run vs. sender.RunNoIgnorePauseFile. But I agree it was a bit fragile approach.\n\nI modified the test to run crash_sender again with --ignore_pause_file. As a bonus, we can verify that the crash dump was not processed by checking that the latter run actually processed the dump. What do you think about this approach?",
