It\u0027s a lab concern, and today, that\u0027s managed via the network_WiFi_UpdateRouter test, plus some manual attention from the lab team. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a concern for this first phase of porting.",

In Autotest, the DHCP server is just an implicit part of \"start hostapd\" (hostap_configure()), and we never actually care about providing the interface index (0) -- we just want a unique subnet for each hostapd instance.",
