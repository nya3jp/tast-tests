Seems like we could have OpenConfig, WEPConfig, WPAConfig, etc., types just as easily. I don\u0027t think we\u0027re trying to hide much between these packages/types, are we?\n\nThis separation is probably fine too I guess. I\u0027m just wondering why the split.",

In its current usage, wouldn\u0027t it be a little clear to remove this state, and just keep the []Option slice here? And then Option could operate on a local Config constructed in Gen(). We\u0027d also change the type to:\n\n  type Option func(*Config)\n\ninstead of\n\n  type Option func(*ConfigFactory)\n\nOr if you do need this to stay as a \u0027blueprint\u0027 object, it\u0027d be nice to leave a comment about why. Same for the WPA package.",
