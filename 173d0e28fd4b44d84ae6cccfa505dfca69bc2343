The kernel limits to 128 characters; per man(5) core[0]:\n\nThe maximum size of the resulting core filename is 128 bytes\n\nI believe that applies both to core filenames as well as piping to programs.\n\n[0] https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html",

      "message": "I checked kernel code and also do a testing, there is no such limitation for expanded core name. I create a file with 250 chars with file name and it crashed, crash reporter correctly handled it and I don\u0027t see any filename truncating. It seems kernel will just dynamically expand to a longer name.\n\nMy main question is: do we have any thing in infra side to expect that this string has a length limitation?  As far as I know, the limitation for filename is 255 bytes. So it could be 240 bytes longer than before.",
