So the caller don\u0027t need to know the problem is from dbus and call IsDBusError. I can draft a cl to see if it\u0027s more readable.\n\n\u003e Is it possible to do any mocking for this?\n\nI think we don\u0027t leave an interface between shill and dbusutil to mock now so we might need some refactor before adding the test with mocking. (Or maybe there are some golang tricks I don\u0027t know.)\n\nAdding local tests as unit test of support package is still an option, I guess.
