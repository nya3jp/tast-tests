I do see it\u0027s for the purpose of having the uppercased functions of the lowercased consts to have the ability to be preprocessed. Perhaps we can use a decorator or an overarching procesing function to keep the invocation consistent while still abstracting the implementation from the developer?\n\nWDYT?",
