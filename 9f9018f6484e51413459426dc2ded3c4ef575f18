Thanks,",

      "message": "This needs to be reworked based on the offline discussion with Eliot and Hidehiko. After my second thought, I don\u0027t think this approach of combining SetUp and CreateWindows work everywhere particularly for some tests that call ash.CreateWindows to open additional windows on top of the already opened not from a clean start.\n\nI feel either (1) SetUp returning a closure closeaboutblank or (2) br.Close(AboutBlank or Window) would be the best we can do given the situation.\n\n```\nbr, closeAboutBlank, ... :\u003d browserfixt.SetUp()\nash.CreateWindows(...)\nif BrowserType \u003d\u003d TypeLacros with any other conditions {\n    closeAboutBlank()\n}\n```\n\nHidehiko, Eliot, do you prefer any of these or suggest something else?",
