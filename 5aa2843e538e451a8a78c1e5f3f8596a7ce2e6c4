      "message": "No action needed, just for my notes:\n\nI guess I know why you put the slice literal before pre.SoftwareDeps; append can reuse the underlying array of the first argument if its capacity is large enough to accomodate new elements, thus it is generally unsafe to reuse a slice after passing it to append.\n\nHowever, in this case, pre.SoftwareDeps is initialized with a slice literal, so its capacity is guaranteed to be the same as its length:\n\n\u003e A slice literal describes the entire underlying array literal. Thus the length and capacity of a slice literal are the maximum element index plus one.\nhttps://golang.org/ref/spec#Composite_literals\n\nSo I believe we won\u0027t see issues even if we pass pre.SoftwareDeps as the first argument of append.\n\nBut anyway, I like the current way of passing a slice literal as the first argument so that we won\u0027t hit any issues even if we make changes to the definition of pre.SoftwareDeps.",
