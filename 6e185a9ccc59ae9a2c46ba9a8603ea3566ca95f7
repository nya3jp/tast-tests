      "message": "Hey Jun,\n\nI know that you have done stuff with perf tests before so I added you as reviewer. This is just a port from autotest. Is this all I need to do to get results in crosbolt? I have seen some mention of \"src/third_party/autotest/files/tko/perf_upload/perf_dashboard_config.json\", but it does not look to have any arc tests listed in it. I assume it is only needed for the Chrome Performance Dashboard and not crosbolt?\n\nThanks,\nBrendan",
