      "message": "Hi Andrew, \n\nWe might want to discuss further on this requirement. \n\nHowever, as we want to run this only on DUTs connect to Amari callbox, we might want to create a separate test suite for this.\n\nWe also have a test suite that runs specifically on callbox (cellular_callbox): https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chromeos/config-internal/+/refs/heads/main/test/suite_scheduler/configs/cros_cellular/cellular.star#280\n\nI assume we would need to do something similar for tests on Amari callbox as well.\n\nMy proposal:\n\n1. Add attribute to identify amari_call_box tests: cellular_amari_callbox.\n2. Add this attribute to all tests that we need to run on this callbox.\n3. Create a new test suite - with desired frequency and target builds to run the suite. (Need inputs on this)\n4. Create a new pool in HTL lab for DUTs deployed for this purpose. Pool name could be pool:cellular_amari_callbox\n\nI will work on creating the suite once points#1 and #2 are complete.\n\nIt might be good to have this discussion in b/ for the record. \n\nRegards,\nDinesh",
