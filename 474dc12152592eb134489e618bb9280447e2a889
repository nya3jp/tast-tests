My understanding is that the option is to restart the app so that the activity starts with a clean slate. It might not be so useful for out test, but should be harmless and I\u0027d like to keep it.",

I think the documentation in Android developer is a bit hard to understand (maybe it is easy for someone with contexts) - a newbie like me will find it hard to understand on the first read.
