      "message": "For App Load Time, it should not affect test metrics / results if arc_eth0 is not available.  Mainly because the communication with nethelper is not profiled.\n\nBut on the APK side, there will be a predefined configuration where it always prefer arc_eth0 unless if it\u0027s not available (see below).  I think by default OS will also choose eth0 if both eth0 and wlan0 are available.\n\n```\nAssuming we have eth connection in lab we should enforce using it or otherwise.\n```\nFrom https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2380176/comment/dd530f0a_57815a74/ this might not be possible since not every board has ethernet port.  In this case, connection with nethelper will likely timeout without additional listeners and test will fail?  https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/2380176/comment/dd530f0a_57815a74/\n\nSince all interfaces are being listened including arc_eth0, and assuming no changes to Android App which say was using only arc_eth0, this change should work the same from the perspective of test app.  For other instances mentioned below from https://crrev.com/c/2380176, the change should be more robust if certain interfaces are not available based on tast infra or board hw spec?\n\n```\nIf you are trying to open a server on the host for Apps to connect to, you should be careful about assuming that the app traffic will go through arc_eth0 all the time. In reality this depends on multiple factors inside Android, mainly 1) which network is Android default network, 2) which Android API is the app using.\n\nIf you have eth0 and wlan0 then it is true that by default the Android default interface is ethernet, and by default any Apps using the non network specific APIs will use the default network. But both points are not guaranteed. For instance if we want to test with a VPN on, nethelper will not work.\n```",

My main concern here is to use predictable behavior. How devices are connected does matter I think.\nAt first step I would try to see if strict limitation \"eth\" does work in lab. Once we have results we can decide what to do next.\nTo address this you may pass {\"arc_eth+\"} to start. BTW, arc_eth+ or arc_eth0 to have stricter limitation.\n\"this might not be possible since not every board has ethernet port.\"\nI don\u0027t recall I saw chromebook with ethernet port. In all cases we use dongle.\n\nSo, could we start with stricter rule? You may pass filter for this case. If it does not work we can modify only filter to get everything working\n\nWDYT?",
