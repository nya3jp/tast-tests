      "message": "Hi Please review this CL. Thanks!\n\nThe reason why I didn\u0027t split the creation flow to another function:\nI tried but realized that saving file to the right location needs the entire creation flow, which mean every line in creation_flow.go is needed.\n\nHaving 2 tests like one tests the CreationFlow and one to test CreationFlow+saveFileToTheRightLocation seems redundant...Plus I think verifying the saved to right location also serves the purpose of creating a video, which is not a thing that is unrelated to screencast creation(for example tutorial dialog).\n\nLet me know your thought!Thanks!\n",
