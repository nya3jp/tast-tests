If the goal is to get the system into a state where it\u0027s swapping heavily it\u0027s seems like our only option on 16gb systems where this value is likely much higher than the low watermark. What do you think?",

Does this idea make sense? After allocating 6.6GB we should still be able to allocate an additional 1GB assuming these compression ratios held.",
