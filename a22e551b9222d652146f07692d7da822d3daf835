If the test succeeds for once, then it can be guaranteed that panic() cannot happen without changing the source code.\n\nNote that constants are not defined here because it\u0027ll run into the same naming problem. Previously each mechanism struct is returned by a function, but the function is very not readable because it\u0027s full of acronyms and we can\u0027t do it with CamelCase or underscore due to style guide.",
