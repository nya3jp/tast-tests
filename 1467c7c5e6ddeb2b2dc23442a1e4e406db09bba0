      "message": "To clarify, based on the discussion on go/robust-ucm-changes, we shall allow alsaucm to fail if the device is not plugged.\n\u003e front mic, rear mic\nDidn\u0027t think about that. Maybe `hwdep.Microphone` does not imply SectionDevice.\"Internal Mic\" exists. Need to take a look.\n\u003e BT offload\nWhether offloading is enabled can be detected with cros_config. Unsure about availability of `hwdep`.\n\u003e Line out, headphone\nNo `hwdep` available. I think detecting \u0026 skipping at run-time is a no-go as the test scheduler might decide that the test can be run in a dut without a headphone, then the test becomes incorrectly skipped (while another dut with a headphone connected is available in lab), introducing flakes.",
