      "message": "There would be an exit failure from running \"cros_healthd --probe_battery_metrics\" if the system didn\u0027t have a battery. This isn\u0027t expected to happen on anything but Chromeboxes. This would make the test fail though. Is there a way to run this test on non-Chromebox devices only or is there a way to check the device type within the test itself?",

      "message": "I suppose that since the number of metrics are limited now and I don\u0027t anticipate adding a rapid succession of battery metrics anytime soon, it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to keep the battery probe and this test in sync. In the future; however, if many metrics are to be quickly added, this test can be refactored.",
