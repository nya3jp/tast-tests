      "message": "We\u0027d still have to pass in the out directory, which is usually found using the test state `s`. I think in practice we aren\u0027t supposed to pass in the testing state into anything outside of the test file. Thus, I think our options then become: do I have a single filepath variable, or two variables (the out dir and the test name). Before I make the change to all the files, do you have an opinion on which of the options you prefer? \n\nOne note is that different teams who use the recorder might want to append different things to the name (maybe a date, the build number, etc), so I want to make sure we have options for them as well.",
