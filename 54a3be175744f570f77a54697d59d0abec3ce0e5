      "message": "random observation: as a future improvement, it may be cleaner to make this function return an image.Color. i assume the reason this package declares its own Color struct is just so it can maintain a count in this function -- is that correct? if so, the struct could just be inlined here, and the function could still return a new image.Color at the end.",
