      "message": "Added a comment explaining the number: Since we get aggregated histograms,\nI expect we need a couple hundred video frames displayed to make them \nsignificant, and since the video capture device produces either 30 or 60\nfps, 20 seconds would give us 600 - 1200 video frames, which are not too\nmany but would fill up the buckets nicely. I could reduce it to 10, but I\nthink 1 second would be too short and not give time to the WebRTC internals \nto settle down after the connection is open.",
