Can\u0027t we reuse the same tests, and use something like \"android_p_or_vm\"? The tests themselves should be able to detect the platform we\u0027re running on and account for any differences.",

      "message": "There is an \"arc\" dependency, but that\u0027s apparently meant for running non-ARC tests only on boards that have ARC.\n\nAs for something like android_p_or_vm, that\u0027s not supported right now. I asked about it in the ARCVM chat last week: https://dynamite-preprod.sandbox.google.com/room/AAAAOWNQg6I/4EfPj9h4qfc. It sounds like how to handle the combinations of Android versions and informational/critical tests is still up in the air. For this case in particular, there\u0027s also the issue of not supporting arm ARCVM.",
