      "message": "@alexanderhartl@google.com WDYT if we extend this method to allow passing the SAML login implementation, and then move `handleMicrosoftLogin()` from chrome_saml.go to this file?\n\nThen we could do something like\n```\ncr, err :\u003d chrome.New(\n\t\tctx,\n\t\tchrome.SAMLLogin(chrome.Creds{...}, chrome.HandleMicrosoftLogin(...)))\n```\n\n(the method would be called [here](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3871029/6/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/internal/login/gaia.go#196) instead of early return)\n\nand then we would not need to call `WaitForCryptohome`, `WaitForOOBEConnectionToBeDismissed`, `RemoveNotifications` directly in the test - it will be easier to write new tests that depend on SAML.\n\nWould something like this work / make sense?\nAlternatively, we could just move the shared login code into a fixture when we will have more SAML tests.",

      "message": "Unfortunately, this leads again to dependency cycles (uiauto and a testConnection are currently required for the SAML login). To fix this, I currently see two paths:\n1. Rewrite the Microsoft login using plain js queries (similar to how it is done with the current GAIA login possibilities). This matches the current login style and keeps the usage consistent, it will however increase the effort to implement logins with other IdPs. And we need to implement a `CustomLogin` option, which still will give control back to the test (e.g. for fake IdPs as in the [Device Trust tast test](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/3871029))\n2. Implement a helper method for SAML login tests where we pass a SAML login callback as well as chrome options, which is implemented similar to that:\n```\n   cr, err :\u003d chrome.New(ctx, options)`\n   callback()\n   WaitForCryptohome()\n   WaitForOOBEConnectionToBeDismissed()\n   RemoveNotifications()\n```\nNew tests could still just run SAML login with one call, logins with new IdPs could be easily added and custom functionality could be injected as well. The usage will be slightly different (no longer `chrome.New(...)`)\n\nIf anyone has other ideas, please let me know 😊",
