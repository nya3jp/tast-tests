      "message": "Each ui operation that does polling has a 10 second timeout. Some filesapp methods may do multiple ui operations. This means that they will have multiple 10 second timeouts.\n\nIf this fails, it will return an error like:\nfailed execution on step 2: failed to select file ...\n\nThe framework will not retry any actions. This will only run once and will stop on the first error. Things like selecting a file will poll until it has stably found the file, and then it will send out a click.",
