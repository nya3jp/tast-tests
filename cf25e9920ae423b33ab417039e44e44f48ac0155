      "message": "So I tried to look for a solution that would wait for the animation, however ran into a roadblock when I realized that it is the LoginAuthFactorView that is translating instead of the arrow button, which is a child of LoginAuthFactorsView. When I attempted to use Finder to find a ClassName(\"LoginAuthFactorsView\") node, it  couldn\u0027t find one. I saw that we use repeated clicks within a time duration for other tests, so I thought it made sense to use here. I am interested to know if there is a way we can find and wait for the LoginAuthFactorsView translation",
