      "message": "A good point! The root cause is certainly a side effect of opening a new lacros browser on startup right after login when lacros primary is set and open from shelf. I think this flake could be fixed by your CL that suppresses a startup window. Tbh I was a bit reluctant to working around it in a way of bypassing user data cleanup since a clean start is expected for this test.\n\nBtw, I wasn\u0027t able to confirm if the new flag (--disable-login-lacros-opening) works okay with your CL. I may have tested with wrong OS/lacros builds where the flag is not yet in?\nThus, I\u0027ll be updating to \u0027DO NOT SUBMIT\u0027 and abandon this CL once your fix gets in and verified. Thanks for pointing this out.",
