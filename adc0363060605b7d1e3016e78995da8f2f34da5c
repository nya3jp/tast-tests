      "message": "I tried a few things but didn\u0027t find a very good way to replace this:\n- Detect the WARN_ON with crash file under /var/spool/crash: trigger the similar thing with \"echo 1 \u003e /sys/kernel/debug/mwifiex/mlan0/reset\", but when triggered multiple times, only the first one will have crash file. (not yet sure if it\u0027s expected) so this is not very accurate.\n- Drop this directly as mwifiex_sdio_card_reset will cause disconnect event in iw: This might not work for other driver, e.g. trigger some \u0027reset\u0027 with \"echo $TYPE \u003e /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/$PHY/ath10k/simulate_fw_crash` on grunt, but there will not be disconnect event. (We won\u0027t really lose coverage for this case, though)\n\nAny suggestion?",
