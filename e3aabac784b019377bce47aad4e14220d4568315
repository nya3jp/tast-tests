      "message": "I have different opinion. ReserveForClose shall be router type specific. Making it a function we need to assume all type of routers needs the same amount of clean-up time. If we have confidence that the assumption is valid, we shall consider renaming the function as its naming scope is the wificell package, not just router.go file. Even more, as all router types share the same value, we can just provide a constant, like TimeForClosingRouter \u003d 5*time.Second, and let caller calls ctxutil.Shorten(TimeForClosingRouter).",
