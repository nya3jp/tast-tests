      "message": "Thanks for the clarification.\n\nSo it is more like a refactoring to use runtime generation of testing.Param for power tests. I understand that now.\n\nI\u0027ll let tast owner to weigh in on this approach. Personally, I vote for this approach since it is easier (and less) to write and more readable than `genparams` approach.\n\nIf owners are okay with this approach, I still think we should leave the ARC tests alone and apply the approach to CUJ tests that are owned by us.",
