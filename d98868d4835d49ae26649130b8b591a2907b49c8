      "message": "Hi Everybody: \n\nI got it to work with two DUTs with tablet mode. Here is a list of what I have done\n\n1. Call apps.Launch instead of my new launcher.LaunchApp\n2. If the DUT is in tablet mode, call ash.SwipeUpHotseatAndWaitForCompletion\n\nMy test still failed on kodama. I don\u0027t have a kodama at hand so I don\u0027t know how is the GUI looks like in kodama.\n\nI will clean up the code. Right now, it is a bit messy. I don\u0027t really like solution #1 so I will also look at the alternatives. \n\nPlease take a look to see if I am in the right direction. Thanks.\n\nSeewai\n",
