Questions:\n\u003e - Do you know the reason why it is so slow only on VM?\n\u003e - According to tastboard, the test passes in 4 mins. Where did you find the problem?\nWhen I remove the --force option, the timeout occurs: see https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromeos/builders/vmtest/amd64-generic-direct-tast-vm/b8876621564724821712?\n\nhttps://storage.cloud.google.com/chromeos-vmtest-archive/amd64-generic-direct-tast-vm/8876621564724821712/first_results/tests/platform.DMVerity/log.txt\n\n2020/06/24 02:39:54 Started test platform.DMVerity\n2020/06/24 02:39:54 [02:39:52.857] Running testNoModify\n2020/06/24 02:39:54 [02:39:53.078] Running testZeroFill\n2020/06/24 02:42:00 [02:41:58.931] Running testAFill\n2020/06/24 02:42:00 [02:41:59.565] Running testFirstBitFlip\n2020/06/24 02:42:44 [02:42:43.449] Running testMiddleBitFlip\n2020/06/24 02:43:27 [02:43:26.658] Running testLastBitFlip\n2020/06/24 02:43:53 [02:43:52.859] External command failed: signal: killed\n...\n2020/06/24 02:43:53 [02:43:52.861] Failed release command losetup for device /dev/loop2: context deadline exceeded\n\nZeroFill takes ~1 min, each BitFlip ~45s. I would expect the whole test to take ~5 minutes. I can reduce the length of each BitFlip test instead: the loop test 100 blocks, half would suffice.\n",
