Doing a polling on the pp3300 itself seems like an overcomplication: we are really just waiting for the electric current to settle, essentially a local version of the toggle in remote: https://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/remote/servo/methods.go;l\u003d307",
