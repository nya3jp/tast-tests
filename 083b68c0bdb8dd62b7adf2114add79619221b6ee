It works before the test execution starts but then stops working because the context was cancelled.\nCreating a new context for the go routine does not work as then the ServiceDeps are missing in the context.\nTo solve this I need to create a new context with the ServiceDeps, but I haven\u0027t found a way to do that yet as the required method: https://osscs.corp.google.com/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast/src/chromiumos/tast/internal/testcontext/entity.go;l\u003d37?q\u003dWithCurrentEntity\u0026ss\u003dchromiumos%2Fchromiumos%2Fcodesearch cannot be called from user code.",
