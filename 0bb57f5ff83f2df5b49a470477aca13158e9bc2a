      "message": "i\u0027m not sure that this belongs here. where is \"dumpsys display\" getting this state from? is it just a downstream consumer of something else?\n\nthe kernel exposes a tablet mode switch device, which reports a state that comes from the EC, which (iiuc) determines the mode by inferring the lid angle based on accelerometer readings.\n\npowerd watches the switch and uses it to report the state to chrome. does chrome pass it to android?\n\nif that\u0027s the source of the state that\u0027s being returned here, i think it makes more sense for tast to get it directly from powerd. you can make a GetSwitchStates d-bus method call to get back a protobuf. iirc, chrome\u0027s code to do this is in PowerManagerClient, if you want to take a look at it.",
