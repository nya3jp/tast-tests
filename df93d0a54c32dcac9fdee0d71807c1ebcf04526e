      "message": "this function feels odd. It just picks some arbitrary network device, depending on this ordering, and then only tests one of them. Is that what we want? I guess there\u0027s no real benefit in running this on multiple devices (wlan and ethernet)?\n\nI guess this is a faithful port, so maybe just leave this alone. But something to rethink eventually.",

I\u0027d look at the original bug links on the other test to see what seems reasonable, but my guess would be that 10 seconds with a 1-second (or smaller) interval is plenty.
