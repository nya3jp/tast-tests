Run the crasher\n2. Use WaitForCrashFiles to ensure that the crash shows up\n3. Check the contents of the .meta file\n\nSee https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/crash/seccomp.go for an example of a test that does something not entirely dissimilar.",
