I looked at logs from a few failures, but in all cases the test started at least 30 seconds after the fixture was set up.\n\nDoes this CL fix inputs.PhysicalKeyboardEnglishTyping and crbug.com/1204926?",

I put a stopwatch on it a while back, and IIRC, the test starts around 30 seconds after the fixture is set up, but it isn\u0027t ready for around 40 seconds.",

      "message": "Hmm, I\u0027m surprised to see the bug (crbug.com/1204926) saying that restarting UI takes ~30 seconds on esche/jacuzzi. Does it have real impacts to users, e.g. logout\u0026login takes tens of seconds?\n\nIn particular I\u0027m wondering if it is a product issue or test issue. The test is consistently passing on other boards... Do you know what is special about esche/jacuzzi?\n",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know what the difference is between running the login through tast and through the real login screen, but I can say the following on the esche model leased on skylab:\n* After running the test, when I clicked logout and then \"browse as guest\", it only took a few seconds.\n* After completing OOBE for my OTA, it took around 30 seconds to log in. When signing out and signing in again, it only took around 10\n* No matter what method I used, I was unable to see the screen that you see when logging in through tast / after running \"initctl start ui\" (white screen except the bottom-right has the little notification bar with a clock and the input method or something).\n\nSo to sum it up, I have no idea if it\u0027s a product issue or test issue. My suspicion is that the test codepath is slightly different, so it\u0027s an issue that won\u0027t affect end-users, but I can\u0027t really tell.",
