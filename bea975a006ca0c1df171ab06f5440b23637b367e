I looked at logs from a few failures, but in all cases the test started at least 30 seconds after the fixture was set up.\n\nDoes this CL fix inputs.PhysicalKeyboardEnglishTyping and crbug.com/1204926?",

      "message": "Hmm, I\u0027m surprised to see the bug (crbug.com/1204926) saying that restarting UI takes ~30 seconds on esche/jacuzzi. Does it have real impacts to users, e.g. logout\u0026login takes tens of seconds?\n\nIn particular I\u0027m wondering if it is a product issue or test issue. The test is consistently passing on other boards... Do you know what is special about esche/jacuzzi?\n",
