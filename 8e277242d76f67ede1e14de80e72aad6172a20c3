      "message": "Can do! A lot of the tests started becoming dependent on the refactoring (otherwise I was pushing duplicate code which seemed worse) and the tests became very similar to previous tests I had written (i.e. scroll/zoom/etc on touchscreen) which caused it all to be done quickly and bunch up into a large CL with many dependencies. I\u0027ll get it all split up, though.",
