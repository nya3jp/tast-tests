You can see the other participants\u0027 video, and you can talk to them if the device has a microphone. We can collect performance data related to the inbound video streams. It is still a reasonable test to run.",

      "message": "That\u0027s true. I do think that will hide a lot of problems we are having with the \"missing outbound video stream\" error message though. Right now, only puff/kaisa and fizz/kench should have this error message, but there are a slew of other devices that currently are failing because of it, when we expect them to be showing their video. I think there\u0027s an issue with some devices just not turning the video on, and I want those devices to fail the test so we can identify the issue and fix it.",
