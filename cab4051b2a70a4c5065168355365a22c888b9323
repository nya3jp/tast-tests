It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve written any go code, and I\u0027ve never written a UI tast test before. :-)\n\nThe test failures are unrelated to my CL. (Is there a way to tell gerrit to just give up and retry again with ToT? I was trying to wait for at least 1 green tryjob before sending this to you. Unlike chromium gerrit there\u0027s no button to pick a bot to add to a CL.)",
