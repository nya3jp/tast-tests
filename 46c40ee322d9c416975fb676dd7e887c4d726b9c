      "message": "Hi Kyle \u0026 David;\n\nI just turned my octopus to a tablet by flipping the screen. I could not drag and drop icon with my finger. Not sure how I can drag and drop to create a folder. Maybe this test is not relevant to tablet. Should I restrict this test to chromebook, chromebase, and chromebox.\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai",
