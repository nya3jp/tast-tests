      "message": "Hi Kyle \u0026 David;\n\nI just turned my octopus to a tablet by flipping the screen. I could not drag and drop icon with my finger. Not sure how I can drag and drop to create a folder. Maybe this test is not relevant to tablet. Should I restrict this test to chromebook, chromebase, and chromebox.\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai",

Going forward if you think there would be more const\u0027s like this, consider making a constants.go file similar to this:\n\n\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/ui/quicksettings/constants.go\n\nIts completely up to you if you want to do that now (ie, make the constangs.go now, and move this there) or leave as is. Either is good with me",
