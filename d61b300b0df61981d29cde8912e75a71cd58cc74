I\u0027m not sure on what timing the function is called (for example, my package does not seem to be unistalled when I run this test locally), but anyways given that not so many tests explicitly uninstall packages [2], I think it\u0027s okay to omit cleanup here.\n\n[1] http://cs/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/arc/fixture.go?l\u003d207\u0026rcl\u003d95d5d6b5b37fe8f182e85efa4500ffd067d1804c\n[2] https://source.corp.google.com/search?q\u003da%5C.Uninstall%20file:%5C.go\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromeos",
