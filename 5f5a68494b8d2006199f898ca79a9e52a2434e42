Not much related to this cl)\nBesides, you can start to think of using precondition for handwriting and voice test.\n\nPre:               pre.VKEnabledTablet,\n\nA little more you need to consider is to reset layout after each test. Otherwise in following keyboard test, it might show a voice / hw layout fails the test.",

      "message": "I believe we only need to exclude kevin64. After the last cl, I monitored for over 10 builds, and found the handwriting tests are stable on all other boards, with the only failure reason being vk-not-shown issue, which is an general issue for all VK tests. \n\nWill do that optimisation later together with the parameterization.",
