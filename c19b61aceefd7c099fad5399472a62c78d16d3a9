There are three cases here (none found -\u003e wait on the property change and repeat, 1 found -\u003e return no error, more than one found -\u003e return error).  Those last two cases both return getIface() output and only the none case is handled differently.  I think a comment above pw.WaitAll would help highlight that.",
