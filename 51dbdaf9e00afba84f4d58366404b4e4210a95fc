      "message": "I would like to bring this new piece of code to everyone\u0027s attention. Recently, the security team updated the /tmp directory to not follow symlinks (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/upstart/+/3783196). This broke the test since we need the certs directory containing the CA cert to allow symlinks to be followed for curl (https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--capath) (https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/c_rehash.html).\n\nIn their announcement email, they provided a solution, which I implemented here. I also provided a way to bring it back to the previous mount options in uninstallCerts()",
