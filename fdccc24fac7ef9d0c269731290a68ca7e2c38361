      "message": "Hello Jeremy,\n\nBased on the results from Stainless, this test failed to run on a few platforms due to the \"Failed to hibernate\" error. I\u0027ve modified ECHibernate to use a testing.Poll function instead of hibernate delay, and added fw-testing-config to read whether EC hibernate is supported. I\u0027ve tested this new patch on the following boards: volteer, dedede, zork, kukui, and octopus, on which hibernation turned out to be consistently successful. I\u0027m hoping that this would improve the status in the lab as well. ",
