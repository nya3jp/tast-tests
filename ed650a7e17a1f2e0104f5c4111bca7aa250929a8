      "message": "I\u0027m hesitant to keep context when it becomes unnecessary -- defer is called when the current function returns; in this case it\u0027s entire TaskSwitchCUJ. Also too many defer could hurt the runtime performance (though defer performance has been improved recently). But maybe that\u0027s okay.\n\nFor arcSetupCtx above, I was simply dull so it was defer, but I think that\u0027s not great. Uploaded a new patchset to introduce an inline function to make sure arcSetupCtx to be closed timely.\n\nIn this code path, I\u0027m afraid that inline-function + defer is too complicated and cancelling on every code path would be easy.",
