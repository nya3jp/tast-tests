      "message": "From the bug: \"it looks like the problem is due to power save is on\" -\u003e that\u0027s probably true for some cases, but I recall even on Autotest (where we disable PS), we still fail with a similar symptom sometimes. i.e., there are non-PS reasons we fail to meet the initial thresholds.\n\nAnyway, this change is probably good to make.\n\nBTW, *technically*, a test can get interrupted without finishing its cleanup, which would leave a DUT in a \"bad\" state (power-save disabled). I think we still have a TODO sitting around about whether the TestFixture should re-set power-save for every new test, so I guess that covers my \"technically\" complaint -- we can still evaluate that later?",
