      "message": "A suggestion:\n\nConsider adding \"client-state\", and a proper way to handle this arg (you will need to create a directory to write/read this file from).\n\nClient-state (as you showed me) allows you to easily/stop/start the DM server. In autotest (tast might be different due to go-routines) a test will not end when there is a server running. therefor, for continuous logged in tests you will need to stop/start the DM server between each test and point to the client-state file for everyone after the first.\n\nHowever: If the DM server is being written with the same idea as chrome() in tast (Ie it lives at the test runner level, not the test level), this might not be an issue as you can simply pickup the currently existing DM server.",
