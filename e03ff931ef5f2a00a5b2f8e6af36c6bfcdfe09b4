      "message": "I don\u0027t have any specific objection to closing activities at the end of a test, but I don\u0027t think it will fix the underlying problem.  If a following test is messed up by having a pre-existing activity, isn\u0027t it the responsibility of that test to close the unwanted activities or start itself in a known empty session?\n\nIf we do need to enforce closing activities at the end of every test, shouldn\u0027t that go into the framework instead of each test individually?",
