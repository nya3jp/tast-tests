      "message": "Part of the slowness is likely from http://crbug/1174627 that the chrome test instance started by tast would have a keep alive held by devtools code until Browser.close in devtools protocol is called. As a result, chrome test instance would always be SIABRT killed after 3s and then crash_reporter kicks in to process the coredump.\n\nThe keep alive is added for automation test but seems not needed by chromeos. I will create a CL to remove it.\n\nOTOH, chrome.New is using chrome.LoginTimeout insternally, which is 80s. So the default 1m is a bit too short.",
