      "message": "Hi Michael and Ting-Hao, I\u0027m planning to move the routing and virtualnet package from network test subpackages to shared packages so that they can be reused in non-network tests.\n\nI know it\u0027s going to cause a lot of conflict with your current work on the packages so I think I\u0027ll wait for your patches to be merged first. It would be nice if you could ping me when you\u0027ve finished your work on these packages so I can start moving those. Thanks!",
