      "message": "just to clarify, what do you mean by \"storage drive fail\"? are you concerned that get_fixed_dst_drive stops reporting the fixed disk drive correctly, but we don\u0027t notice that because of this code that falls back to /dev/sda? if that\u0027s the case, wouldn\u0027t the test be failing on many devices because they don\u0027t have /dev/sda? or do you think this will mask some other problem?\n\ntesting for betty isn\u0027t enough, as other boards can be run on VMs. amd64-generic can be used either on a VM or on real hardware, for instance. i could create a new dependency that can be used so that this test will be skipped entirely on VMs, but i\u0027d rather not introduce a one-off dependency if it can be avoided.",
