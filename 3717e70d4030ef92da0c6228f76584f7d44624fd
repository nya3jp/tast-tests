Perhaps there was an infra issue?",

Now I understand the problem.\n\nThere are possible 3 scenarios:\n\na) Test passes/fails -\u003e never screenshots  (as it is today).\n\nRegardless whether the test passes or fails, no screenshots are being saved.\n\nDownside: no screenshots are being saved when the test fails.\n\n\nb) Test passes/fails -\u003e always screenshot (this CL)\n\nRegardless whether the test passes or fails, screenshots are always saved (assuming \u0027path\u0027 is passed as argument).\n\nDownside: screenshot is being saved, even if the test passes.
