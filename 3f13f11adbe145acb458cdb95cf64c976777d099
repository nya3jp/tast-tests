CDP really isn\u0027t a good choice for anything but low-level operations, in my opinion.\n\nsee https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Target/#method-activateTarget, for instance: the entire documentation given there is \"Activates (focuses) the target.\" i don\u0027t see any methods for related operations like maximizing a window, toggling fullscreen, determining how many tabs are present in a window, etc.\n\nnearly all of the methods listed at https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Browser/ are marked \"experimental\", and at least some of them are buggy (getHistogram doesn\u0027t collect data reported by other processes).",
