      "message": "The formulas are right. But I think the names are imprecise.\n\nObviously we want tight stencils?\n\nDo you think it would make sense to set these parameters to 8 and 1 first, then collect distances from the lab, then 7 and 2, and if that still has big distances, 6 and 4? Or you already know that you need 6 and 4 or larger stencils?",
