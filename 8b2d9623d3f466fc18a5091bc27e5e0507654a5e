      "message": "The formulas are right. But I think the names are imprecise.\n\nObviously we want tight stencils?\n\nDo you think it would make sense to set these parameters to 8 and 1 first, then collect distances from the lab, then 7 and 2, and if that still has big distances, 6 and 4? Or you already know that you need 6 and 4 or larger stencils?",

      "message": "That makes sense, but I think you meant starting with 7 and 1 (if I set edgeOffset \u003d 8, it would fall outside the border; e.g., the left border occupies pixels 0 through 7).\n\nWith 7 and 1, inner_top_left_11 gave me a distance of 168 for 360p_composited. That\u0027s quite large. How about we start with 7 and 2?",
