      "message": "With some caveats. Involving Chrome\u0027s rendering pipeline might be somewhat problematic: if WebGL rendering happens to be broken in Chrome but lower level CrOS graphics is fine, we might end up blocking Chrome uprevs (which may or may not be desirable) since this test is in the commit queue.\n\nBased on the bug, it seems Ilja doesn\u0027t mind involving Chrome, so it\u0027s probably okay.\n\nOne might argue, however, that Chrome OS already uses GL to render its UI, so issuing WebGL commands might not exercise the lower level graphics stack much more and we do it only to get an image for which we have a reference.\n\nWe might alternatively consider taking a screenshot of something like one of the platform/drm-tests which use GL for rendering and bsdrm to page flip (which is aware of modifiers and AFAICT plumbs them with ADDFB2). But I\u0027d like to hear Ilja\u0027s thoughts on this.",
