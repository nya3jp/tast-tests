      "message": "launcher.New() looks NOT like a fixture, so we should have some other way.\nOptions I can come up with:\n- Using NewFixt(), so it\u0027d be launcher.NewFixt().\n- Introducing new package for lacros fixture, e.g. chromiumos/tast/local/lacros/lacrosfixt, so that it\u0027ll be lacrosfixt.New.\n\nPersonally, latter sounds easier for readers, since it contains \"lacros\". WDYT?",

      "message": "Thanks for addressing this concern! \nIMHO it would be nice to consider having these naming/structure similar to ash-chrome as much as possible so that test writers can easily understand how to use them between ash or lacros in general. \n\nAn example in mind is that\nchrome.NewLogginInFixture (in ash-chrome chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/fixture.go)\ncould be matching\nlacros.New\u003cAnyDesiredStateOrNoneByDefault\u003eFixture (in lacros-chrome)\n\nI think changing the package name \u0027launcher\u0027 to \u0027lacros\u0027 makes it more clear, which could probably be done as a part of https://crbug.com/1237972 it seems.",
