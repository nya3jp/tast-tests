      "message": "FYI @Shuhei, @Seewai,\n\nLooks like \u0027Other\u0027 targets involve a lot of things. I would suggest not to close `other` targets by default, but add necessary targets case by case. WDYT\n\nI can see some other failures in closing targets between tests. \ne.g.\n\"Failed to close https://meet.google.com/download/webapp?usp\u003dchrome_default: context deadline exceeded; last error follows: failed to wait for target closed within time\"\n\"Failed to close https://mail.google.com/chat/download?usp\u003dchrome_default\"\n\"Failed to close https://canvas.apps.chrome/install/: context deadline exceeded\"\n\"Failed to close wsConn: rpcc: the connection is closing: websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF\"\n\"Failed to close chrome://print/: context deadline exceeded\"\n\"\"\n\nThis causes long time delay(10s on my test) in resetChrome and potentially trigger internal errors.
