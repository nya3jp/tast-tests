I see the goal, but I think it should only be like this in a specific test that is testing the edge case, but not in the library that anyone can use....I\u0027m not fully sure though.",

      "message": "I could just return immediately after pressing the key in these cases if you\u0027d prefer that. Basically I just didn\u0027t want it to return an error if the slider is at 0 or 100. It seemed better to me to keep it flexible and just have it model the user interaction, but we could get rid of this specific verification step. What do you think?",
