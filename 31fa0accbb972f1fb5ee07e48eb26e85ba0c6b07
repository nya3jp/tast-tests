      "message": "Yes. Thanks for the comment.\n\nI understand your point. Action and test should be different. However in my opinion, validation function is also an action with information to attach. \n\nI will complete pending cls and stop further refactoring until we get an agreement how to use UserAction. We can involve more experts into this discussion too(maybe Matt).",
