We initially started it for Brya project and we are continuing the efforts for ongoing projects as well.\n\nWe have a plan to create a separate suite for Intel tests in this quarter. But creating a separate package will be difficult, as in many case we are reusing the existing libs and importing these libraries from other packages to Intel package is not possible.",
