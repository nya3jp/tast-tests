      "message": "\"vp9_hdr\" is like \"av1\", \"h264\" etc, meaning it just tests playback regardless\nof the video decoder being used (sw, hw or hw-then-falling-back-to-sw), whereas\nthis one verifies hw use. Perhaps it should be called \"vp9_hw_hdr\" so the\ntaxonomy is clearer?\n\nPegging it on kohaku is so that the Compositor changes between AB24/AB30 FB,\nbut in principle we should extend it to all KBL+ devices eventually.",

      "message": "The naming is fine with me.\n\nIt just seems that as it is, vp9_hw_hdr would give us all the information we need: both vp9_hw_hdr and vp9_hdr are restricted to kohaku (for now) and both play the same video. So if vp9_hw_hdr fails, that\u0027s all we need to know that something needs to be fixed, and if it falls back to software, vp9_hw_hdr would also tell us this. I could see vp9_hdr being useful if it wasn\u0027t restricted to a model, i.e., to verify that something is played on all boards regardless of HW decoder support or compositor capabilities.",
