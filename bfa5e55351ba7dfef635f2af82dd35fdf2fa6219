      "message": "This was a fairly straightforward translation of the network_WiFi_BSSTMReq.py logic, copying from roam_dbus.go for the \"detect when roaming happens\" logic.\n\nPart of the test logic involves getting into a state where the DUT has no knowledge of the second AP it will be roaming to. I chose to use the wpa_supplicant \"FlushBSS\" method (the same behavior that Autotest was invoking via `wpa_cli bss_flush`) to start with. Is that the best option or is there a Shill equivalent I should use instead?",

      "message": "From the context described in crrev.com/c/2342587, FlushBSS is to ensure that the DUT has no knowledge of the second AP as you said, so it looks good to me to use the wpa_supplicant API (and also I didn\u0027t find something similar in shill).\n\nOne thing I\u0027m not sure is that if this FlushBSS is really necessary. When we connect to the network, there is only one AP so bgscan should be off by default. In this case, I think DUT is unable to notice the second AP already. (To verify my guess, I added a 3 minutes WaitForBSSID before FlushBSS, and it will timeout as expected.)\n\nIn any case, I think it still does no harm to ensure it again with FlushBSS.",
