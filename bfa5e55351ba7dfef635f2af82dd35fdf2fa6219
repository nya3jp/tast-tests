      "message": "This was a fairly straightforward translation of the network_WiFi_BSSTMReq.py logic, copying from roam_dbus.go for the \"detect when roaming happens\" logic.\n\nPart of the test logic involves getting into a state where the DUT has no knowledge of the second AP it will be roaming to. I chose to use the wpa_supplicant \"FlushBSS\" method (the same behavior that Autotest was invoking via `wpa_cli bss_flush`) to start with. Is that the best option or is there a Shill equivalent I should use instead?",
