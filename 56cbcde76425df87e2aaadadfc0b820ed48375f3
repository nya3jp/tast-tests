I\u0027m not totally sure if this is something we should address generically in the chrome package? Or maybe I\u0027m misled? +hidehiko, in case he has ideas in this area (I\u0027m not the most familiar)\n\nAnyway, what I *do* know is that intentionally slowing down shill-start-user-session is enough to cause this to fail.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/master:src/platform2/shill/init/shill-start-user-session.conf?q\u003dfile:shill-start-user-session.conf",
