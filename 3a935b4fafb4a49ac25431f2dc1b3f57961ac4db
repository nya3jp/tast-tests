      "message": "I would like to see how effective is it before adding this logic to more camera tests. Note that things are a little bit tricky:\n\n- For camera.HAL3* tests, what we want is ensure the camera service is \"not\" running, so it\u0027s out of scope.\n\n- For camera.GCA* tests, we need to check the system prop ro.hardware.camera to know which camera service it would use (arc-camera/cros-camera)\n\n- For WebRTC tests I would like to wait until the renaming/moving settled. We might want to add this to webrtc.go as a utility function instead of putting this ~10 lines at the beginning of every camera related WebRTC test.",
