      "message": "Hmm, I see what you mean. I am unsure whether there is any alternative if the goal is to automate the manual test though.\nEventually we will probably also want to have tests for the rest of the printing policies, like `PrintingColorDefault`, `PrintingPaperSizeDefault`, etc, which would also highly depend on the print preview UI not changing. \nThus I would be in favour of submitting this CL as it is, and revisit this topic once we add tests for the other printing policies. Does that sound good?",
