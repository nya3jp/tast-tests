      "message": "Thank you Jie and Hugo for your comments.\n\nI want to make it clear, as I did not previously, that this is a WIP patch. At the end of review I want to able to commit a http package that can be used as a captive portal. Given some of the discussion below, I feel like we could also end up creating a test that uses captive portal as long as the http package is listening on the veth interface. Please correct me if any of this seems like it does not make sense. Let me know what you think!",

      "message": "There might be several other reasons:\n- The veth service is not Connected in shill, so we need to wait for the service state changes (WaitForConnectedOrError() in shill.Service can be used);\n- Even if the service is Connected, it can be triggered by IPv6 and thus IPv4 may be still not ready, so access the IPv4 address in the netns may fail.\n\nPossible solutions for the second point are:\na) Polling the server (curl in this case) until it works (for example, see the routing.ExpectPingSuccessWithTimeout() func in this WIP patch: https://crrev.com/c/3689373) (or perhaps add a function like \"WaitIPv4Ready()\" which use ping to check the IPv4 availability before curl)\nb) Checking the statuc of IPv4 IPConfig object on this service;\nc) Checking the IPv4 address on this interface directly.\n\nBut I don\u0027t have a clear idea on which is the best here (perhaps a)?) now.",
