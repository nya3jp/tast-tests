      "message": "Originally I added the text as a hack to get the test working (it wasn\u0027t in the original Autotest), but with uiauto it\u0027s far more straightforward to check whether a button is visible rather than what the contents of a text field are. It also allows for slightly simpler code without the additional HTML element :)",
