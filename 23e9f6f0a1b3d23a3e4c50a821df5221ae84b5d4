That probably requires 2 more bools, a \"P2PDeviceIfaceFound\", and a \"NeedP2PDeviceIface\" which is true if we find a GO or client. Then another comparison like line 91.\n\nNot terribly complex, but IMO less clean than the other way. WDYT?",

      "message": "Hmm interesting. Generally, the absence of a type from a combination means that there is no concurrency allowed for that type in that combination. (put another way, there is an implicit `{type} \u003c\u003d 0` for every non-referenced type). It really comes down to the nuance of how p2p-device is being overloaded. Are you referencing a specific documentation on this? It comes down to whether the correct explanation is \"every P2P-GO and P2P-Client is also a P2P-device\" or \"P2P-device is a special case that encapsulates additional restrictions for P2P-GO and P2P-Client.",
