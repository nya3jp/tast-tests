I saw dedede/metaknight had the camera turned off frequently though so verified through crosfleet that this fixed worked, at least when I ran it.\n\nI still expect to see the error message some times because some devices seem to have camera issues, but hopefully this fixes the ones where clearly the camera is just turned off.",
