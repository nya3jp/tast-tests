However, that might be a while https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/3671104 given the failures there. What do you think about having this CL disable `PersonalizationHub` feature for those input tests again?\n\nWe will put up a follow up CL to remove the `--disable-features\u003dPersonalizationHub` and merge that as soon as successful uprev happens.",
