      "message": "When in the suspend state, kukui [a detachable device] did not seem to respond to a key press emulated by servo. I saw a message in the logs that says \"Keyboard was not on for call. Turning if off again\". I\u0027m guessing that perhaps suspending a detachable would also mean detaching the keyboard. \n\nFor now, I\u0027ve added a tab on power button to wake detachable devices instead. But, we\u0027ll continue to test on other detachables.",
