      "message": "Hey Madhav! See also https://buganizer.corp.google.com/issues/248221881 Most of the failed tests in UIOta*Sms tests were due to the SMS not being received properly, which I believe happened because of the SMS storage getting full in the modem. In theory it should be Chrome deleting the SMS after it is shown in the UI, and for some reason that is not happening.",

      "message": "Agreed. Maybe the test could start out with manually clearing the SMS list just to make sure problems don\u0027t leak in from other tests or from broken behavior elsewhere, but there should be a test somewhere for the deletion behavior (if not in this test).",

This should cover most of the test failures.\n\nOn L850, I did see one failure, where even after deleting the messages, no new messages were being delivered till the modem was restarted (using gpio pin). I was not able to repro it on other modems. Let me see if I can add a check for L850 and restart the modem.",
