      "message": "Hi David, sorry for not providing enough context. Checking the test result in https://tastboard.corp.google.com/test/factory.Toolkit, most failures (except for the error `Failed to check TPM state`, which is fixed in CL: crrev/c/3244560) are connection related, such as `SSH connection is not available`, etc, which fails before running any code of the test itself, so I suspect it is environment related. Any suggestion or idea about what could go wrong about the test itself (calling the wrong API, setup in the wrong order, etc) is welcome, we also eager to get rid of these error.",

Looking through a few of the tast.DEBUG logs, two lines which stick out are \"Closing DUT SSH connection to ...\" and \"Opened DUT SSH connection to ...\". For the passing cases, the most recent one of those lines is \"Opened DUT SSH connection to ...\", while for the failure cases the most recent one is \"Closing DUT SSH connection ...\". I\u0027m not familiar with that part of the tast infrastructure, but it\u0027s a good place for you to start investigating.",
