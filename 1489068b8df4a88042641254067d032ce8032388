      "message": "Where did these lists come from? Is there a reason why these tests are expected to be flaky on these boards/models but not others? I don\u0027t think not having observed failures on the \u0027stable\u0027 boards is a good enough argument to add them to CQ, given that the there are multiple different boards which are all slightly flaky. It\u0027s entirely possible that the \u0027stable\u0027 boards are also flaky, but we just haven\u0027t seen it. Is there a compelling reason why every board not on this list is expected to always pass?",
