I\u0027ll add the method we\u0027ve used in case to the lacros porting document if it\u0027s okay. Composing the parent fixture value is a bit less boilerplate than using interface embedding, although I think it would get messy if there\u0027s more fixture inheritance - e.g. what happens if something inherits from one of these new fixtures - now you have to reference .ParentFixtV.ParentFixtV somehow. With interface embedding this doesn\u0027t happen.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any thoughts on this.",
