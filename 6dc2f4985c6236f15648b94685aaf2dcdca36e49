      "message": "As discussed on chat with khmel@, As these tests are doing opt-in on a fresh chrome at the beginning, Play Store should be shown at the end of Provisioning. PS not displaying appears to be an issue and should not be ignore which this cl is doing.\n\nHence will resend this CL with additional android logs to be dumped on failure to debug this further. \n\nThanks",

It should be sufficient for them to only opt-in to execute rest of the flow they want to test.\n\nThere should only be one test that fails if playstore doesn\u0027t open up, every other test should simply not check/care about playstore opening.",
