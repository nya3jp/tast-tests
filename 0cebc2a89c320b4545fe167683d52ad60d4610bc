      "message": "Whether the test result can include the right screenshot (before lock screen) depends on the relationship between screen lock timeout and package install timeout (i.e. number of packages and timeout per package) plus time spent on other parts of the test (likely very short).\n\nWhen someone unknowingly changes one or more of those factors, the test may no longer get the right screenshot (before lock screen). If we care about this, it\u0027s best to use a test (or part of this test) to ensure that.\n\n",
