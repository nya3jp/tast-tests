      "message": "It\u0027s new to me that other services are using the similar functions. I had a wrong impression that the design is only used in shill and others are using the more common DBus.Properties: https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-java/api/org/freedesktop/DBus.Properties.html. It\u0027s probably because I see that shill/property_store* is under shill dir and that we have a copy of \u0027const char kGetPropertiesFunction[] \u003d \"GetProperties\";\u0027 in system_api/dbus/shill/dbus-constants.h.\n\nIs there a doc for the dbus APIs that you\u0027re going to use? I\u0027d like to take a glance out of curiosity.",
