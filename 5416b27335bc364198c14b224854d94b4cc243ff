We will need to increase the timeout again when we start actually performing scans, but we don\u0027t need anything higher than the default right now.",

Or I\u0027ve never seen one fail to scan Letter if it successfully scanned the whole platen and A4.  However, I also don\u0027t have a proposal for how to get \"enough\" coverage without doing every combination.  As long as we can get through them all in some reasonable time, maybe it\u0027s best to just leave the full nesting in place for now.",
