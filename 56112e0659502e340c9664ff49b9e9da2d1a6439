      "message": "It\u0027s pretty hard to debug errors from this function without it, since you don\u0027t know which step failed. As I\u0027m using this function more, I needed the improved debugging -- I couldn\u0027t figure out some of the problems I was having without it.\n\nhttps://chromium.git.corp.google.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/b69f1f6b49ec6cbd4ac1eb367d48df3d9bbdd48c/docs/writing_tests.md#error-construction suggests wrapping errors like this.\n\nIf you really feel strongly, I can move this change into a different commit, but it seems pretty small.",
