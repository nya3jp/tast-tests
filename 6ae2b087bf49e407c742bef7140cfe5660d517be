      "message": "yeah, I\u0027m kinda hesitant to do this, but I don\u0027t think directory is supported.\n\n- agree that WPR (replayer/cache) is a good solution for this. It\u0027s a bit complicated to deal with other preconditions like lacros / skia_renderer\n- another solution is to simply use a single zip file to hold those files.  Tast doesn\u0027t unarchive zip files, but it wouldn\u0027t be hard to do that by yourself with standard https://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip/ package",
