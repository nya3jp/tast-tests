      "message": "By the way, I would be fine to tentatively add kip and monroe into the skip list for 802.11ac, right? Even if we know that some do and some don\u0027t support it, I don\u0027t think we really care that much about precisely verifying all the latest features on such old devices, do we?",

      "message": "Using board/module to decide if a DUT supports 80211ac is imprecise given the fact that AC7260 has two modules, one supports 11ac and one doesn\u0027t.\n\nFrom the Stainless result, we found that in addition to kip, guado may also have the mixed AC7260 WiFi module issue.\n\nWe can put both kip and guado in 80211ac testing blacklist as short term solution.\n\nHowever, in the long run, we may move wlan_device_info.go to hwdeps and use that to decide if a DUT supports 80211ac by probing which WiFi module the DUT has.

Long term, yes, we want to do all these sorts of things via HardwareDeps. https://crbug.com/1070299 is kinda blocked right now though, IIUC.\n\nAnyway, this probably isn\u0027t the appropriate place for that discussion. Would $BUG be the right place?",
