      "message": "This test case demonstrates how a test wrapper can be implemented by calling tast from tast.\n\nThis test has the following constraints:\n1. It depends on a tast change that expose runtime variables to test https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/3454485\n2. tast-tests \"meta\" category is not suppose to be used by tast unit test only. Need verify with tast team to see if this is the right approach to achieve the purpose.",

      "message": "This way of running the CUJs is perfect for the quick run, where total running time is expected to be relatively short. However, for the full test suite, this way would result in ~20 hours of running time, which is too much for stainless to handle. Instead, we\u0027d like to run all iterations of existing tests in one go, i.e. ui.TabSwitchCUJ2.nasic_noproxy_full with run 10 iterations of the ui.TabSwitchCUJ2.nasic_noproxy test case.",
