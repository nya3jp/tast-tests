I also left suggestion in bug to have chromium switch for this. I am also ok to go as is if you think it is better solution in current conditions.\n\n\u003e\u003e I was also thinking IsKernelVersionAtLeast belongs better in sysutil.go. \nThis SG however TAST owner point of view might be better in this case.",

So my current solution using android-sh is only a stop gap until they clean up all the other android-sh use cases in tast/CTS for previously stated security objective.\n\nhttp://doc/1iG1cXOQKQPFSC1F3r1G_seVXYNncAG1pZVobMdOVkck#heading\u003dh.ip31u66aaw99",
