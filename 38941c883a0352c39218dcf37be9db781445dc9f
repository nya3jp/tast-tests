      "message": "Maybe we shouldn\u0027t expose arguments like directly in our testcases. I would also prefer not duplicating \"--test-launcher-timeout\u003d180000\" in every test that requires it. And why is the launcher timeout set to 3min while the test itself has a timeout of 4 minutes.\n\nMy suggestion is to keep things a lot simpler. I would just always increase the timeout. Managing test timeout here is the responsibility of Tast, not the launcher. Just set it to a value higher than Tast (5min? 10min?) that will cover our usecases in the future.",

      "message": "Does the VEA binary test manage timeout by itself? If so, it makes sense to add \"--test-launcher-timeout\" option here.\nEven in that case, it\u0027d be nice to avoid duplicating this flag among tests. How about adding \"Timeout\" field whose type is time.Duration in encode.TestOptions?",
