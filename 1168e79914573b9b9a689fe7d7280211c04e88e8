      "message": "Unfortunately, for some reason, all tests pass most of the time, but sometimes the transition from the guest fixture to the regular user fixture causes all regular user tests to fail. I believe this could have something do with the mount namespace not being set for all go threads. I noticed an option to make a syscall on all go threads (https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/285597/) was somewhat recently added, but I wonder if it could suffice to always enter either the user session or the init mount namespace when setting up a `loggedInFixture`.",
