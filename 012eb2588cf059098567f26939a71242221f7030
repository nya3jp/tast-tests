      "message": "hmm.. I thought you are right about the same instance part. I double checked again with the planner code and they only checks the name field.\n\nChecked stainless[1] of how our tests behaves, the precondition.Prepare function for each tests are consuming ~ 0.05 sec, which I assume the code works.\n\n+nya on how the precondition instance is checked. If change has to be made, then I think I can have a quick fix to that.\n\n[1] https://stainless.corp.google.com/browse/chromeos-autotest-results/swarming-4f32b4bd15355d10/",

      "message": "Yes, it works right now because there are no two tests using the same config. The internal trace tests use 16 GiB, the external trace test uses 6 GiB, and disk_io_perf doesn\u0027t actually run anywhere (and maybe there\u0027s an additional separation between the internal and external tests? I\u0027m not sure).\n\nI noticed this because my test refactoring in CL:2374267 moves the precondition from the test-level to the parameter-level, which means all the trace tests have \"different\" preconditions with the same name.\n\nThere are a number of hacky ways you could make this work, but I think all of them end up worse then just making a seperate test to test setting the disk size, which is what you actually want.",
