I double checked again with the planner code and they only checks the name field.\n\nChecked stainless[1] of how our tests behaves, the precondition.Prepare function for each tests are consuming ~ 0.05 sec, which I assume the code works.\n\n+nya on how the precondition instance is checked. If change has to be made, then I think I can have a quick fix to that.\n\n[1] https://stainless.corp.google.com/browse/chromeos-autotest-results/swarming-4f32b4bd15355d10/",
