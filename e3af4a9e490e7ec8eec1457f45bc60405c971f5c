      "message": "So I don\u0027t think I was testing the right patch ðŸ˜ž. The service I should be waiting for is org.chromium.MojoConnectionService. When I test waiting on this dbus service, Chrome does not have time to send cros_healthd the mojo remotes. I think this leaves me with a few options:\n\n1. Add a sleep in the SetUp of the fixture to give Chrome time to bootstrap cros_healthd. (Not ideal, but this would work)\n\n2. Add a polling mechanism to wait until cros_healthd has been bootstrapped before continuing. \n\n3. Use the chrome.New() mechanism even though it is not needed in the fixture. This seems to give enough time for the bootstrap indirectly.\n\n#2 Would probably be the cleanest solution, but do you have a preference?",
