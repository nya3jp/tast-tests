      "message": "I wonder what is a guarantee this snapshot gives to tests. Could you remind me when local_tpm_data is modified and when we have to rollback local_tpm_data?\n\nready.Wait is called on the beginning of a local bundle executable, but a local bundle executable may be executed multiple times to run local tests, e.g. when a local test crashed in the middle of execution. Thus having this code does not guarantee that the snapshot is taken before all local tests.",
