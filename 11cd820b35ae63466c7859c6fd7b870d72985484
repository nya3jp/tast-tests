      "message": "DUTs have network connection, but most packages needed for test are pre-installed in the test container image in this script: https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/master:src/platform/container-guest-tools/lxd/lxd_test_setup.sh;drc\u003d559141204bcd0995bbf8b2aded81e2f286d3c35e\n\nThe tests also seem to run the install as a command in the test, but this is usually a no-op as the package is already installed.\n\nIf installing a package from network is a test case we want covered, perhaps we should install a (small) package in one test case, but the others might be better pre-installed.\n\nOne thing I worry about with this approach though is that pre-installing large apps (eg android studio/open office/gimp) will make the conatiner images much larger and may prevent any tests from running on boards with low disk space.",
