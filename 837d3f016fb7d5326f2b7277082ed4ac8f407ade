      "message": "Is it possible to get this JSON file by chrome-binary-tests*.ebuild instead of putting it here?\n\nThis JSON file comes from Chromium repo and may be going to be modified in the future, right?\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/media/test/data/test-25fps.h264.json\nIn this case, while changes for test binaries in Chromium repo will be reflected automatically when Chrome uprev happens, JSON\u0027s change won\u0027t be applied. Then, we will need manual changes, which should be annoying.\n\nSorry for not finding this earlier, but WDYT?",

      "message": "does the test binary assume that there\u0027s a .json file in the same directory as the video file that gets passed here? i\u0027m a bit concerned about assumptions like this reducing our ability to e.g. store different data files in different directories later (that\u0027s why there\u0027s a DataPath function instead of DataDir).\n\nwould it be hard to instead pass the .json file to the binary as well, and make this function take both an absolute video and .json path?",
