      "message": "Is it possible to get this JSON file by chrome-binary-tests*.ebuild instead of putting it here?\n\nThis JSON file comes from Chromium repo and may be going to be modified in the future, right?\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/media/test/data/test-25fps.h264.json\nIn this case, while changes for test binaries in Chromium repo will be reflected automatically when Chrome uprev happens, JSON\u0027s change won\u0027t be applied. Then, we will need manual changes, which should be annoying.\n\nSorry for not finding this earlier, but WDYT?",

      "message": "As discussed: I considered doing this, but making modifications to the .ebuild file is a slow and painful process. And I expect adding new data files might be more common than modifying existing ones.\n\nTo avoid these files being checked in at two places in the source tree we decided to move it to gs://chromiumos-test-assets-public/, next to the video file. It\u0027s a bit more convenient to maintain both the video file and its accompanying metadata if they are stored together.",

      "message": "It\u0027s indeed assumed a json file in the same directory exists. This is also the case for the current video decoder tests, which requires multiple files to be present, and additionally requires many of the video\u0027s properties to be passed through command line arguments. The new video decoder tests consolidate all that information in a single json file that\u0027s always stored next to the video file.\n\nI don\u0027t see any immediately usecase for separating the video file from it\u0027s metadata file, but its easy to add an argument to overwrite the default metadata location.
