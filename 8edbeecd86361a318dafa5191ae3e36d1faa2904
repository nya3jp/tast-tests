      "message": "I agree, it is a bit weird and fixing the underlying issue would be ideal. I thought it might be useful to provide this in the meantime, since it\u0027s something we\u0027re running into pretty often. Could save some potential headaches for test writers. I\u0027m also guessing a general solution for click-readiness across the accessibility tree could be a bit of ways off, so having an easy-to-find workaround seems like a good thing, especially for such a fundamental interaction with the UI.\n\nWith that being said, I\u0027m also open to keeping the polling local. The codelab demonstrates it, so maybe that would be enough to raise awareness. I\u0027ll register a bug for sure, though.",
