      "message": "Hi Ross, \n\nDisney is failing due to \"app is not compatible with the device\". Please find the bug for this, https://buganizer.corp.google.com/issues/145689582#comment3. As per the comment app might be not compatible if the build is not CTS pass. So it is genuine failure. Thanks.\n\nRegards,\nMeena\n",

I am not sure how this information is surfaced to Play Store.\n\nI will look into adding it as a tast dependency to skip the test, but I not sure how easy or hard that will be to do.",
