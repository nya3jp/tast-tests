      "message": "It does carry some risk on \"old\" devices. Recent version of coreboot (see https://crrev.com/c/2765538) will ignore tables in VPD, so that\u0027s no longer a problem. But we could potentially have older devices out there with older branches of coreboot that have VPD entries and CBFS entries and VPD is the one that gets loaded. I think there was discussion to backport the deprecation of VPD back to older coreboot versions, but that\u0027s a bit risky. We could restart that effort maybe? Maybe get some field data to see if that actually happens?",
