      "message": "The change itself LGTM.\nRegarding the whole function, I feel like there should some error handling, as there can be some errors in one of the 3 checks, and the function can return false even if the device is a legacy device.\n\nAs I saw this function is only used at 2 places, so it shouln\u0027t be a lot of extra work to modify the function to return with an error as well (in a separate CL).\n\nI feel it would be hard to find the root of the flakiness the lack of error handling can cause here.
