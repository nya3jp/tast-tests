We can simply do no-ops for launching request if the user action would somehow trigger the launch code while SWA is not ready(Suppose user may keep trying the same action until the SWA is ready). In that way, we still need this CL to prevent the test triggered launch request hit the no-ops code path.",

My assumption is that when Chrome reaches CameraAppUI, it means that the camera app should be available.\n\nTo be clearer, I assume the upper layer should either:\n1. Queue the navigation until the SWA is ready\n\nor\n2. Drop the navigation if SWA is not ready\n\nI\u0027ll consult with SWA team to see if my understanding is correct and understand \nwhat the best practice should be.
