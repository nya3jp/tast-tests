      "message": "I need some help to understand the intent behind the test.\n\nIs it necessary to use the Google search in this case?\n- If yes, wouldn\u0027t it be better to enter the \"searchQuery\" in the address bar instead of navigating to the page? As it is right now, I don\u0027t see how could the \"searchQuery\" appear in the system information.\n- if no, I would suggest to create a HTML page, include it into the test as data, and start an HTML server with it, and connect to that page. This way the title of the page is known.\n\nWhat breaks if the username is included in s.Errorf()? Which info.Key will contain the username form that?",

      "message": "It\u0027s not necessary to use google search specifically, but we *do* want to use something that is a non-localhost http(s) page, because the redaction tools we have in place treat file:// (and possibly localhost?) URLs differently from web pages. I chose google search because it\u0027s a fairly reliable service.\n\nI\u0027m looking for the searchQuery in the page as a sort of backstop in case we don\u0027t fetch the title of the page correctly at first. It\u0027s not strictly necessary, but doesn\u0027t hurt to collect.\n\nIf the username is included in s.Errorf, it will go into /var/log/messages, which is one of the logs we retrieve.
