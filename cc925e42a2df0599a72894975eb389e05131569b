As it is right now, I don\u0027t see how could the \"searchQuery\" appear in the system information.\n- if no, I would suggest to create a HTML page, include it into the test as data, and start an HTML server with it, and connect to that page. This way the title of the page is known.\n\nWhat breaks if the username is included in s.Errorf()? Which info.Key will contain the username form that?",
