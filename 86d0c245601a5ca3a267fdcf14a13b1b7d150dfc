      "message": "Keep the loop (incl s.Run) in each test and just pass policies, allowedURLs and blockedURLs to this function; rename to CheckURLBlocking or something similar. The function would then not need to receive state as a parameter.\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/docs/writing_tests.md#test-subpackages\n\nIf there were more tests that worked in the same way I would merge them all into a single parametric test that took the table as a parameter. In this case I think moving the checking function to a shared package is sufficient.",
