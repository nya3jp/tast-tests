      "message": "Hello Sarthak,\n\nThis is a follow-on to my cryptohome.FileStability test from a few weeks ago. This attempts to replicate the circumstances of the ChromeCrashLoggedIn flakes more precisely, by having one process write files while the golang test reads them.\n\nIt\u0027s already showing failures -- if you look at the latest amd64-generic-direct-tast-vm failure (https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromeos/builders/vmtest/amd64-generic-direct-tast-vm/b8844055741070657920/overview) you can see errors like:\n\nLoop failed: file /home/user/59cca754f985e1ea785b73746654315a707b0d3a/SequentialConsistency/SequentialConsistencyTest.2.txt disappeared after creation\n\nwhich is the type of \u0027flickering\u0027 I\u0027ve been worried about.\n\nDo you see something I\u0027m doing wrong here? Should the test succeed or am I misunderstanding? I\u0027m not doing \u0027sync\u0027s but my understanding is that syncs are only needed if you want to be sure the data is written to the physical media; it shouldn\u0027t affect the ability of other processes to see the files.\n",
