      "message": "Probably best to note why the action needs to be passed in as an argument than just being placed earlier in the chain.\n\nRelatedly (and very optional), did you consider an alternate design:\n\nlistener \u003d uiauto.EventListener(node, ev)\nuiauto.Combine(\nlistener.Listen()\nbutton.Click()\nlistener.WaitAndStop()\n)\n\nWhen we did the initial uiauto design as well we considered having an event listener always registered at the root of the document when the context is created.  Would that have helped here?",

Requiring \"defer listener.Release(ctx)\" is an option, though I don\u0027t think that fits well with uiauto design.",
