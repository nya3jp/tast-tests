      "message": "\"common\" is designed to put the library code which works for both local (i.e. on DUT) and remote (on Workstation (or the one equivalent in the lab)).\n\nHowever, the ones in the depending CLs looks like the code which only works on local or remote? If so, could you keep them in the local/remote directories properly?\n\nAlso, in the case, if you do not have any plans to use those libraries from outside of hwsec tests, could you put them in chromiumos/tast/{local,remote}/bundles/cros/hwsec/${subpackage}/...\nrespectively?",

      "message": "This code is designed to work on both local and remote test. It aims to provide the same set of interface for accessing cryptohome on remote and local tests. For remote tests, cryptohome is accessed through executing commands on SSH, while for local tests, it\u0027s either executed directly or through dbus calls.\n\nSome of our tests have to be remote because they involves rebooting the machine due to hardware constraint. Meanwhile, it doesn\u0027t make sense to make the other local tests remote. These local and remote tests have some common code, and that\u0027s what this package is for.",
