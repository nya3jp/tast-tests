Rather these failures are caused by the lack of WEP support on ath11k, which *should* be covered by the WiFiWEP dependency, which isn\u0027t working correctly on Hoglin. It\u0027s worth noting that I\u0027ve previously observed the WiFiWEP dependency correctly causing these tests to skip on a Piglin device, but not on Hoglin.",
