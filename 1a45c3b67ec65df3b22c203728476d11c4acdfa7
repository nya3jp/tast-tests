      "message": "In my understanding, we actually don\u0027t have to calculate the score here; I think it is better to report individual subscores (i.e. height / width / refreshRate) separately. The score calculation can be done by the analysis script, that way we can refine and reevaluate the TPS later.",

Or add a flag to recorder to ensure that this is called just once.",
