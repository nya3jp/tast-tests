      "message": "In this particular case the issue is with those boards, not with the test, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good reason to delay a test catching regressions exactly like this not to be enabled. Maybe there should be a guideline for adding boards to CQ too, to ensure they are passing all the tests before being added.

      "message": "Basically informational should be removed after we confirm it is stable enough. Failures can be ignored if it\u0027s not related to the issue. You\u0027re right about zork, the boards seems really problematic. So we can ignore their failures.\n\nStill I think flakiness of rikku and guado is related to this test and I worry about that.

      "message": "Well, the test is as stable as it could, given its nature - after all it\u0027s a real \"go type in password and wait for google to sign you in\". But it\u0027s a baseline for a few other tests already in CQ, which assume this functionality working.\n\nLooks like rikku and guado somehow are enterprise-enrolled devices (some of them?) which breaks OOBE flow:\n\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1101611#c3\n\nSo the fix would be unenrolling those devices. It has nothing to do with the test really.",
