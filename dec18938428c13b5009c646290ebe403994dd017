      "message": "In this particular case the issue is with those boards, not with the test, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good reason to delay a test catching regressions exactly like this not to be enabled. Maybe there should be a guideline for adding boards to CQ too, to ensure they are passing all the tests before being added.
