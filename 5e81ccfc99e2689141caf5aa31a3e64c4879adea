      "message": "So my take on this would be: Before the google3 change this should have been flaky - would have maybe capitalized on the field (probably not, maybe about 1% flake or something).\n\nAfter, we should always get caps, so if we are inconsistently getting caps now, that is probably a bug.\n\nAnyway, LGTM",

      "message": "Thanks for the comment, John. From my understanding, auto capitalization is relatively low priority feature. It is a bit annonying when it fails and breaks other tests such as typing testing, which is the core function. My suggestion is that once auto capitalization change landed, we can do a sepearte test design to understand the feature and clairfy the expectation. Then we add some tast tests on it and make the feature enabled by default after. WDYT",
