      "message": "The shorter name looks nice, but then key and values will be separated into different sub-packages (key in *prop and values in *typename) which make it hard to find the related constants. If we group key and values together, then property keys are separated...\n\nDo you think the fragmentation might be a problem? Or the convention is enough for finding the sub-package maybe?",

      "message": "Patchset 5 contains the proposed layout. PTAL.\n\nAlso found one more problem:\n- the package name shillconst/security conflicts with wifi/security, move it to shillconst/securitytype can fix it but the name is still kind of general.\n\nWDYT? IMO, the information looks quite fragmented in this layout, with only 10-ish constants in each package, so I slightly prefer the single package design for reasons:\n- Easier to find related information. And probably also easier for auto-complete? (I don\u0027t use auto-complete myself, so I\u0027m not really sure. :p)\n- The name is longer but also informative and specific. i.e. if not aliased, shillconst is clear that this is only used for interacting with shill.",
