      "message": "Hi tbarzic@, I noticed that there was a recent refactoring of metrics reporting:\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2608848\n\nThe purpose of this tast test is to measure first-run performance of opening the Assistant UI when it triggers Better Onboarding. \n\nBetter Onboarding expands the height from kPeeking to kHalf before the kClosed-\u003ekPeeking transition animation completes. This used to \"work\" in that the state transition happened and metrics were reported for the final kHalf state.\n\nOld behavior:\n\nSetState kPeeking\nimmediate SetState kHalf\nReport Metrics kHalf\n\nnow no metrics are reported.\n\nWhat do you think are the options here?",
