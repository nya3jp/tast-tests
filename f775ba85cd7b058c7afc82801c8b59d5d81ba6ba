      "message": "Before, the test didn\u0027t run for `coreTestDuration` appropriately, which is why the approximately was necessary. Basically, the test would run for sometimes 3+ minutes over `coreTestDuration`. Now, the tabs will switch for at most a couple seconds over `coreTestDuration`, which I thought didn\u0027t require such an explicit \"approximately\" qualifier.\n\nPlease lmk if you want me to put this back!",
