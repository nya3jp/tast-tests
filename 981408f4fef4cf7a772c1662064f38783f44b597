      "message": "I wonder: do we want a timeout for this that isn\u0027t the \"whole test\" timeout? e.g., if the whole test is given X minutes, we probably don\u0027t want to be waiting here for several minutes in a failing case -- we could probably declare a failure if we can\u0027t configure and roam in about ~1 minute or so? (Autotest gave a default of 30 seconds for \"wait_for_connection\", but we\u0027re also including AP setup here.)\n\nI\u0027m curious if others have thoughts -- perhaps I\u0027m making up a non-issue, if we really just intend to hit the default timeout case for test conditions like this.",
