      "message": "Yeah I think we will revisit shortcut scoring because the string match algorithm doesn\u0027t always work as expected. \n\nNote that this also means \"isFirstResult\" may not be robust for a Tast test. We\u0027ve had a lot of trouble in the past with Tast tests that fail after a ranking change, which I think is usually indicative that the wrong thing is being tested - ranking/matching is liable to change at any point, so Tast should only check something that we expect to *always* happen in the launcher. WDYT about removing \"isFirstResult\" from the tests?",

I\u0027m not 100% sure that this test case will hold up under all possible revisions of the search algorithm, but an exact substring match has a much better chance of always being correct.",
