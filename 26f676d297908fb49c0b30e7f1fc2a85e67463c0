Also, have the file removal approval by owner. If so, please mention it in the commit log.\n\n2. Please resolve conflicts. Also, I think it is better to split the CLs based different component. Then, add one of the owners of tests in the component as a reviewer. In this case, we will have less merge conflict and I think he coordination will be better this way.\n\n3. I think it may also have code conflict with Derek\u0027s change to remove tests (not just informational tests) that fail 100% in last 30 days. I add him to the CC list.",
