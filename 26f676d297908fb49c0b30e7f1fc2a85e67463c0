      "message": "1, I saw a few files that are totally removed. We just need to remove the attribute related lines, right? Please stay the reason that we need to remove the files. Also, have the file removal approval by owner. If so, please mention it in the commit log.\n\n2. Please resolve conflicts. Also, I think it is better to split the CLs based different component. Then, add one of the owners of tests in the component as a reviewer. In this case, we will have less merge conflict and I think he coordination will be better this way.\n\n3. I think it may also have code conflict with Derek\u0027s change to remove tests (not just informational tests) that fail 100% in last 30 days. I add him to the CC list.",

      "message": "1) Only tests that are marked by OWNERs to be deleted are deleted. The rest are disabled (go/retiring-old-informational-tests-2022). This is also documented in the commit message as well.\n\n2) Yes- I\u0027ll fix the conflicts (this will happen quite often given the # of files). Would like to avoid splitting this CL if possible since going component by component will be around 10+ separate CLs to juggle. \nAlso, for the tests that are not deleted, they are considered pretty much \"abandoned\" since our group escalated to the test owners multiple times to address the unpromoted tests (2+ escalations to individuals + teams) - had a chat with the \"test scaling leads\" and reasonable due diligence has already been done in terms of escalation to owners. If ultimately the owners finally respond and disagree with disablement, it is up to them to re-enable the test at this juncture.\n\n3) Will do- I\u0027ll CC Derek as well",
