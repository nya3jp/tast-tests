      "message": "sigh, this CL has caused on multiple places -- you are not only the one.\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure what would be the correct thing.  Previously it was broken and didn\u0027t report errors, now it reports timeout error when the CPU load isn\u0027t low enough.\n\nTwo suggestions:\n- power.WaitUntilCPUCoolDown might be a good alternative. Typically it waits shorter and this would be good enough to stabilize the results\n- or ignore the error for cpu.WaitUntilIdle if that\u0027s acceptable",

      "message": "Ignoring the error in cpu.WaitUntilIdle is probably acceptable. The only downside of this is that the performance results will be a bit more noisy, but this is definitely better than having flaky tests. This will probably only affect lower spec platforms anyway. Even if the CPU usage can\u0027t be brought down to less than 20%, any waiting we do should at least stabilize the performance results a bit more.",
