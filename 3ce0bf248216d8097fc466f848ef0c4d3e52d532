      "message": "\"crosHealthdRunning\" fixture not only sets up the environment, but is useful to check some corner case pre/post test. For example, it\u0027ll make sure that the cros_healthd PID won\u0027t change after the test.\nI checked some docs, and it seems that it only support one fixture [*]. Not sure if tast owner has other idea on this if we want to have function from two fixtures.\n\n[*] https://pkg.go.dev/chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast.git/src/chromiumos/tast/internal/testing#Test.Fixture",
