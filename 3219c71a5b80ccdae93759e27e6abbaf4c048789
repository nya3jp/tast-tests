Is it the Tast log for a different log file? I think it is separate log file. Just want to be sure.\n2. How big is the log file?\n\nThanks.\n",

Here is one example (named \"api_tests.txt\"): \nhttps://stainless.corp.google.com/browse/chromeos-test-logs/test-runner/prod/2022-04-07/8ce5e27a-c3ff-4814-b25d-407e12123428/\n\nThis file corresponds to the output of the test. It is not the Tast log file.\nThis file is supposed to be around 4K today. With `CLVK_LOG\u003d2`, it will be the same when the test passes (it is only adding 1 or 2 lines). But when the test fails, it will add precious information. But as I did not move `CLVK_LOG\u003d4` it will not be very verbose. Depending on the issue, it will add 10-ish lines.",
