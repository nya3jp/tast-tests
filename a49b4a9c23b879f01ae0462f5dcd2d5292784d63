      "message": "Hi Everybody:\n\nI have split each of my new function in shelf.go to two functions: one for shelf (clamshell) and one for (tablet). Please let me know if it ok.\n\nAlso, I think I have addressed most of the comments. Please review.\n\nI did encounter delayed issue with a tablet running in clamshell mode yesterday. I think it is out of scope to fix EnsureTabletModeEnabled for this CL. Therefore, I put a sleep instead yesterday.\n\nAlso, currently controller.go is in bundles. Therefore, shelf.go could not call it. In the long run, I think we should move controller.go out of bundles. However, I am not sure it should be within the scope of this CL.\n\nBTW, I have tested the latest code with the two DUTs at home. I am having trouble getting any machine from skylab this afternoon. I will try to do more testing tomorrow.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai\n",
