      "message": "This test might be fragile since it is customized for current VK layout, it is very likely to fail on VK layout changes (especially for symbols), but we didn\u0027t found a VK key list of specific IME.\n\nAbout the ML part,\nsince the procedures have been changed to check each key one by one, e.g.:\n 1.clearInputField\n 2.tapKey(a)\n 3.validateField(„Åó)\n\nDo you mean the expected result might be a phrase instead of a character by this 1:1 tap-validate mechanism?",
