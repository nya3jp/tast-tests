      "message": "The DUT roam only if there was bgscan, before requesting roam and the roamToAP shows up in the scan results. Otherwise, the test fails for the following reason:\n\u003e DEBUG wpa_supplicant[889]: wpas_dbus_handler_roam[dbus] 00:11:22:33:44:56\n\u003e DEBUG wpa_supplicant[889]: wpas_dbus_handler_roam[dbus] Target AP not found from BSS table\n\nI thought the DiscoverBSSID() solved the roaming issue (because it was running fine on the DUTs I was leasing), but it didn\u0027t. The DiscoverBSSID() runs scans and waits for the BSSID to show up in the scan results in wpa_supplicant. It seems there should be something else that I need to wait for before requestion roam.\n\nLogs for pass and fail cases: https://paste.googleplex.com/4535378692276224\n\nChanging this CL to WIP, and I will conitnue investigating this issue.
