      "message": "do we need a better timeout on this loop? Previously, we would only wait for a non-empty Services list, check it, and give either an error or a \"match\" result. Because we didn\u0027t tend to have an empty Services list for long, that was OK. But now, you\u0027ve fixed this loop so that we properly wait for a matching Service, which is more precise, but also may not happen (if the test is going to fail, for instance). So you\u0027ll just fall back to the deadline for the entire test.\n\nSeems like it would be wise to wrap the ctx in a reasonable timeout here? A few seconds?",

      "message": "Timeout added. However, that reminds me a scenario: would it be the case that service is added but the service\u0027s property is not ready yet? If so, the current algorithm does not work: it checks services again to find a match after a service list is changed. If there\u0027s no further service list change, then the expected service property change after the first check will not be captured.\n\nNot sure if I\u0027m thinking too much.",
