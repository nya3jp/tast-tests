      "message": "Adding nya@ explicitly for chrome fixture expertise\n\nThe test in the dependent CL requires that there is not a logged in user to run correctly. Based on the conversations in https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/tast-users/c/4uVick5DE_E/m/11jkXBadBAAJ, I think it makes sense to just stop the ui to ensure that Chrome does not have a logged in user. WDYT of this approach?",

      "message": "Does this timeout make sense? In my experimentation with stopping and starting chrome in tests previously is that sometimes when chrome is hung, it can take quite a bit of time for the process to finally be killed. It might also make sense to modify the timeouts for ensureUI as well.",
