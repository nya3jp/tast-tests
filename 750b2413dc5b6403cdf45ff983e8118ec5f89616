      "message": "Adding nya@ explicitly for chrome fixture expertise\n\nThe test in the dependent CL requires that there is not a logged in user to run correctly. Based on the conversations in https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/tast-users/c/4uVick5DE_E/m/11jkXBadBAAJ, I think it makes sense to just stop the ui to ensure that Chrome does not have a logged in user. WDYT of this approach?",
