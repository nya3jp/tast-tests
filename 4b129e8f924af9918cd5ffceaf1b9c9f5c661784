We added a dbus call to handle the inconsistency between DUT labels and the probe config on DUT in CL:2793908.\n\nWith this CL, we could run tests on dev and beta channels.",

I really want to avoid them... but I think it\u0027s okay if it is due to explicit waivers. According to the CL description, this is a waiver case? If so, could you put explanation in code comments and log messages to clarify that?",
