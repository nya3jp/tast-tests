      "message": "I assume some tasts could still benefit from extra debug logging?  If it\u0027s disabled for tasts, we\u0027d provide a function to use dev conf if needed.\n\nIf majority of tasts are not timing critical, I think encapsulate it with rest of the perf chrome flags into a function (http://b/165872341) as khmel@ suggested and use only in perf tasts makes sense.  Otherwise disable by default. There are a lot of other perf flags floating around so which ever way we go it\u0027s good to put them in one place. Thoughts?  @khmel?",
