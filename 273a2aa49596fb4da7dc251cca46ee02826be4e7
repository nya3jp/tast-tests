      "message": "I may have misled you in the bug - in RoamAPGone, all we care about is the BSSID changing from the first AP to the second AP. We don\u0027t care about any intermediate states because tearing down the initial AP is definitely expected to disconnect the DUT in many cases. In other words, it\u0027s fine if we perform a normal roam to the new AP, but it\u0027s also fine if we disconnect and then reconnect to the new AP.",
