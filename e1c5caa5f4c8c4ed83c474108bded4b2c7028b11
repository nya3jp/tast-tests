      "message": "The usual logs are collected.\n\nSome tests manage ARC instances without preconditions nor fixtures. For example, the arc.Reboot.vm test, which checks ARCVM correctly reboots, doesn\u0027t use arc.Booted() precondition or \"arcBooted\" fixture. We want to collect logs even for such tests.\n\nOf course some tests doesn\u0027t use ARC instances at all, but I think that forcing to use the logging fixture on all tests is not a bad idea.",

      "message": "For tests calling arc.New directly, why don\u0027t we put the log collection logic to arc.ARC? For example, arc.ARC.Close.\n\nIf we put logging logic to a fixture, we have to make sure all ARC-related tests use the fixture, directly or indirectly. I guess you tried to enforce this by adding a unit test, but I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not exhaustive. The unit test can catch tests using chromeLoggedIn, but not other fixtures. Also, we can\u0027t cover tests that are outside of the \"arc\" category (there are many tests calling arc.New outside of the category).\n\nBy putting the log collection logic to arc.ARC, we can make sure all ARC-related tests are covered, since all ARC-related tests should use arc.ARC (possibly indirectly via preconditions/fixtures).",
