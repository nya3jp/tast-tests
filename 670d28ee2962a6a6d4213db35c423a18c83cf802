I think it might be better for the pauses to be much shorter - less than a second, with longer periods of playing. We probably want more than 4 key strokes - it\u0027s not enough to detect anomalous input delay.",

It\u0027s a big problem if the video just stops playing from this point onwards - the test run would be invalid. \n\nWe could add a check to validate it. Check out L573 that gets video smoothness via javascript. We could do `document.querySelector(\"video\")` to get \u003cvideo\u003e (luckily youtube page has only one \u003cvideo\u003e). Then we could use `paused` property to check whether the video is playing.",
