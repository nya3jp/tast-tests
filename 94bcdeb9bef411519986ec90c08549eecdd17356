So we\u0027d want to make sure that we\u0027ve waited for shill (and the wpa_supplicant device it instantiates) to come up.\n\nAlso, I think it would be more precise to look for the main WiFi device, just in case wpa_supplicant is going to pick up a different default interface. e.g.:\n\n  sudo -u wpa -g wpa wpa_cli -i wlan0 ping",

And there\u0027s a chance it could pick up something different than what you intend to test. e.g., 802.1X Ethernet (not likely to be used by default in a lab setting, but it\u0027s still worth a consideration) also uses wpa_supplicant.",
