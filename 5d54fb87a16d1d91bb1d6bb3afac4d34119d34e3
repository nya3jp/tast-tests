      "message": "Hi Alex, \n\ncould you please look this over a bit again? I added the dutConn.CommandContext piece and moved some things around. I can now run this repeatedly with successful outcome.\n\nAt this point I just need one thing and this test should be good to go. Need to figure out how to verify that the \"Enrollment completed\" screen was visible sometime after this line: https://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/internal/login/enroll.go;rcl\u003de99061f2d5c384ce5289b5b5797a41432ddb5a59;l\u003d293. Once I know that the test can check for that instead of the 60 second wait currently.\n\nThanks.",
