      "message": "Daisy,\n\nJudging by [1], I think you can help me with this CL on which I previously gave up. The problem is that when I run the Tast test on my nautilus, overview shows \"No recent items\" even though there are two minimized ARC windows which are visually evident from the shelf. Your discussion in [1] leads me to believe that you are familiar with behavior like that.\n\n[1] go/chat/room/AAAAXQo2RRw/ooxRGk25Qiw",
