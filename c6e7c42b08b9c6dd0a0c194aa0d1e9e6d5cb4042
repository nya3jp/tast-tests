      "message": "Hi Hidehiko,\n\nTo successfully run lacros test on devices with MIPI cameras (e.g. Soraka, Nocturne), we need to use a newer version of Lacros image which contains CL to support MIPI cameras: \"https://crrev.com/c/2763448\" (91.0.4456.0).\nTherefore, I update the Lacros build to 91.0.4463.0. PTAL, thanks!",

I found that the last fishfood is about 4 months ago and I would like to know when will the next fishfood release.\n\nMy intention is to uprev the lacros binary so that I can understand if camera works on all boards and also understand if there is any performance regression for current approach.\n\nAs a result, if the next fishfood will happen soon, I think it is okay to wait for it. If it still needs a few weeks or more, I hope we can uprev the binary first.",
