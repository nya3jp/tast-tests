      "message": "Hi Hidehiko,\n\nTo successfully run lacros test on devices with MIPI cameras (e.g. Soraka, Nocturne), we need to use a newer version of Lacros image which contains CL to support MIPI cameras: \"https://crrev.com/c/2763448\" (91.0.4456.0).\nTherefore, I update the Lacros build to 91.0.4463.0. PTAL, thanks!",
