Please take a look at this iteration when you get a chance.\n\nI\u0027m questioning whether some of the API I created for my tests should be in the uiauto stuff. Seems silly to create a whole new file for two functions just because they don\u0027t technically use uiauto. But if you prefer that, just let me know and I\u0027m happy to do it.",
