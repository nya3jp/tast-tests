It tells cros-disks to mount something, and a side-effect of that (based on existing cros-disks code) is to broadcast the signal.\n\nBut, here, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any existing functionality where we can easily tell Chrome to do something, a side effect of which is to broadcast a FuseBoxService.AttachStorage D-Bus signal.",
