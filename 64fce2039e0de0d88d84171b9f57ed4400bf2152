      "message": "Is it correct that you expect this program to always return a non-zero exit code if any tests failed? Alternatively, would it be better to check that results.failed is actually 0?\n\nAs it seems your behaviour is to append the summary after the error from cmd.Run() anyway, I think it would be cleaner to deal with the exit code and results seperately. Tast should concatenate these anyway when producing the final failure string for the test. I.E. You could replace lines 105 down with:\n\nif err !\u003d nil {\n   s.Errorf(\"Error running %s: %v\", exePath, err)\n}\n\nif results.passed+results.failed+results.skipped \u003e 0 {\n   summary :\u003d fmt.Sprintf(\"Ran %d subtests with %d failures and %d skipped\",\n\t\t\tresults.passed+results.failed, results.failed, results.skipped)\n   if results.failed \u003e 0 {\n      s.Error(summary);\n   } else {\n      s.Log(summary);\n   }\n} else {\n   s.Error(\"No tests were run\")\n}\n\n(Personally, I probably wouldn\u0027t bother \u0027failed to run\u0027 case from the \u0027failure while running\u0027 case. The error message should tell you that anyway. But as another reviewer suggested this I\u0027m happy for you to do this if you want to.)",

Alternatively, would it be better to check that results.failed is actually 0?\nYes, I expect a non-zero exit code if a tests fails. But it seems reasonable to check for FAIL in the logs (as is being done as of this CL). By checking `if results.passed+results.failed+results.skipped \u003e 0` as you suggest, it makes the exceptional case of \"no tests run\" an error, which may not have been the case before. This is probably a good thing.\n\nOne thing I don\u0027t like about having multiple `s.Errorf` is that each one generates a stack trace, which reduces the snr of the log. Is there a way to suppress the stack trace generation?",
