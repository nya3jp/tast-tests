      "message": "Would it make sense to rename this function reorderDeskByInputMethod(...), accept an inputMethod parameter, and perform the switch here based on the type? Right now it seems a lot of duplication is done for the sake of how the desks are moved. By moving where the inputMethod is handled, a lot of this code could be reused, and the main function wouldn\u0027t need a switch (it\u0027s error messages would just .fmt the inputMethod) after calling this function.",
