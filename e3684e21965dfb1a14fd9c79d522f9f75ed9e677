      "message": "Hi. I\u0027ve just uploaded the latest patchset.\n\n@hyung: I\u0027ve mentioned before about my intention to use a single command line that would run all variations on this test. So that idea is implemented now using `VarDeps`, where I\u0027m enforcing the test to always run with the `lacrosDeployedBinary` var, otherwise it fails. \n\nI\u0027m really curious how Chromium builders, specifically Crosbolt, will deal with this `VarDeps` idea. Probably some tweaks will be needed. I\u0027m looking at these now - is there anywhere else I should pay attention in terms of builders?\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/autotest/+/refs/heads/main/server/site_tests/tast/control.crosbolt-perbuild-shard-1\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/autotest/+/refs/heads/main/server/site_tests/tast/control.lacros\n\n@hidehiko: I\u0027m looking forward to analyzing the effects of the results developed here in Crosbolt next and follow-up with eventual changes if necessary. Tha said, I believe this CL is quite ready for your consideration now. Could you PTAL?\n\nThank you,",
