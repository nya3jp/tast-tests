It\u0027s going through a whole flow of platform daemon dependencies + staging artifacts before \"reflashing\" (it\u0027s actually performing a complete AU).",

      "message": "+1\n\nIt\u0027s one thing to make tests get normal software/UI operations in order if needed for their test (Chrome started; logged in; open/close windows; reset daemon state), but it\u0027s another to know we\u0027re even running the right software at all. Verity-disable is an invasive operation which has wide-ranging impacts, and not all tests even *can* do this reasonably (no more local tests?).\n\nI\u0027d rather push on the test-runner/TLS/${whatever} side of things than encourage this patch.",
