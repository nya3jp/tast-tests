Making a new feature \"pstore\" for SoftwareDeps seems more correct way.\nHowever while I read the documents of Tast, adding a new feature is not so easy.\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/refs/heads/master/docs/test_dependencies.md#example-changes\n\nSo, in this CL, I want to just fix the test failures.\nMaking a new feature is TODO for later CL (b/175089029). Is this Okay?",

It\u0027s likely a two line change, one in local_test_runner/main.go, and the other for document describing pstore.\nThe other CL is in platform/tast-tests, like this, but use \"pstore\" instead of amd64.\n\nSo, I prefer introducing it now.\nIf there\u0027s some significant amount of work you find, please let me know.",
