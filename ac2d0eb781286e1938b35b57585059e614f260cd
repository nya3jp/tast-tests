      "message": "Hey Alvin,\n\nI wanted to get your thoughts on this method I\u0027ve implemented for our ARC++ Games testing. ARC++ has had issues with the uiauto.mouse in the past and we noticed that in our game testing suite, it\u0027s extremely apparent and causes a lot of flakiness. I\u0027m not sure of the best function name but the concept of using the virtual mouse, which sends raw events, and slowing down the move-\u003eclick cycle to give the app time to register the events increases the reliability of our tests considerably. The follow up CL which uses this new method is here:\n\nhttps://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/chromeos/platform/tast-tests-private/+/4815557/4\n\nand the devices I tested on (a variety of touchscreen, no touchscreen, chromebox, etc) which all demonstrated flakiness with all the existing interaction methods were validated with multiple runs and documented here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j82AYjLZuapSpqbMwiCpM5oCLod1rzKavGODzHY-Eko/edit#gid\u003d514004734\n\nLMK your thoughts",
