      "message": "It doesn\u0027t matter which type is used for this, as it\u0027s independent. I actually tested with both legacy and openwrt, though I just put the legacy test method in the commit message since it\u0027s not possible to test with openwrt until later in the CL relation chain. The wifi.SimpleConnect.8021xwep test fails with openwrt but it fails after the copy which uses the code in this CL is successful.",
