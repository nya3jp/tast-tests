I actually tested with both legacy and openwrt, though I just put the legacy test method in the commit message since it\u0027s not possible to test with openwrt until later in the CL relation chain. The wifi.SimpleConnect.8021xwep test fails with openwrt but it fails after the copy which uses the code in this CL is successful.",

I mostly wanted the fact that this change has been tested against both topologies to be listed in the TEST section for posterity purposes since it\u0027s not clear that from the commit message that this change is backwards compatible when running the test with the legacy router instead of an OpenWRT router.

      "message": "I think since this CL is separate and comes before the OpenWrt implementation CL it\u0027s most important that it doesn\u0027t break legacy support and provides a working alternative to copying files other than tar. This CL could be a standalone way to copy files other than tar, it just so happens that OpenWrt needs it. The OpenWrt implementation CL will include a test for all SimpleConnect tests, including this one. Thus, I think with the TEST section making it clear that at least the legacy routers pass we\u0027ve got enough here.",
