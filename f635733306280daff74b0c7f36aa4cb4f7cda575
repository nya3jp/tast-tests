      "message": "Ahhhh, I am not a fan of the comments.  Seems like we are adding a Source of Truth or duplicating info that could get out of date.  In the future hopefully our requirements publishing will allow a link to the requirement by ID that is guaranteed to always work (right now updated releases/changes could break links) when that is done I could see adding a link to the source as a comment but I am against duplicating the requirement language.\n\nPerhpas a comment at the start here that says to go to https://chromeos.google.com/partner/dlm/docs/latest-requirements/\u003cform factor\u003e.html to look up definitions from requirement IDs for now?",
