How do you know these have the AOM license?\n\u003e \n\nI asked Timothy (tterribe@xiph.org), who is the author of the files.\nTimothy told us \"These files were all generated by running the libaom test cases, and capturing the output, under the theory that anything someone had bothered to write a test case for would be validated by the corpus. So at worst they should be available under the same terms as the test data used for those tests.\"\n\n\u003e 2) Does the license of the videolan.org files fall under TODO(b/179426205) (both for 8 bit and 10 bit)?
