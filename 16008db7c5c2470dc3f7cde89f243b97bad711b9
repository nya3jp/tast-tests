      "message": "We could make a new feature that is the inverse of `tast_vm`, `no_tast_vm`. The `tast_vm` flag is set here:\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/chromite/+/HEAD/lib/cros_test.py#401\n\nThat flag is poorly documented outside of the chromite source. I will add it to the tast document that lists the available dependencies.\n\nAccording to the doc on test dependencies, flags like `real_hardware` or `non_vm` should be avoided, but something like `no_tast_vm`, that only claims to be the inverse of `tast_vm` (once documented) sounds reasonable to me:\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/docs/test_dependencies.md\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWe should also probably consider refactoring the features in the local_test_runner not to hardcode `betty` in so many places, since there are several VM testing boards now (amd64-generic, novato, one of my team\u0027s boards, reven-vmtest):\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/src/chromiumos/tast/cmd/local_test_runner/main.go.\n\nI created b/202936571 for the tast team to consider that idea.",
