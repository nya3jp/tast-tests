      "message": "Hi Robert,\n\nI\u0027d like to use the dut_power code you wrote to measure power in some ARC tests, but I want to make sure my changes don\u0027t break anything.\n\npower.SuspendConsumption.s0ix fails when I run it on a hatch/helios because there is no ppvar_bat or ppvar_bat_q rails (but there is a ppvar_vbat). Do I need to run this test on a specific board?",
