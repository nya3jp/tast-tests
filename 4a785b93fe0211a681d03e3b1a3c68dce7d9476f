      "message": "That\u0027s possible to add non-intel hwdep, but one concern I have is about multi-source devices. Then, the hwdep.WifiIntel is not a simple inverse of hwdep.WifiNonIntel and we\u0027ll need to maintain yet another list of non-Intel boards/models... As a result, I\u0027d prefer to branch the behavior with WiFi device name than boards/models.\n\nOTOH, I think the test is not really \"skipped\" on Intel WiFi as it still checks if they behave as expected (i.e. is self-managed)\n\n+Dean to see if he has some suggestion.",
