      "message": "It\u0027s just a timeout to wait till we get a stable board. The default is 5 minutes which I think is too long for a CQ candidate test.\n\nNote that I make this call non-fatal, so even if we failed to get a stable machine(CPU/temperature wise), we will still run the verify functions.\n\nI think we can possibly remove the 2 minute wait here and totally rely on the testing.Poll. But then the test may be harmed by any run-away tests from previous testing.",
