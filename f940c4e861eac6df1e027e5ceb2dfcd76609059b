      "message": "yes, in the handover doc we decided to use the following: \n\nBefore promotion owners: clumptini@ \u0026 the original author (some original authors have left the team, hence some tests only have clumptini@ listed)\n\nAfter promotion to critical: clumptini+oncall@ as the owner so our oncaller can filter mailbox for any critical test breakages\n\nAll the tests in this CL should be non-critical, so they all have clumptini@ as a contact. Please correct me if I made a mistake somewhere.",

Since (I assume) these are the tests which aren\u0027t ready for handover let\u0027s keep the individual owner if they don\u0027t report up to dca@ (if they do report to dca@ or there\u0027s no owner besides cros-containers-dev then might as well set it to clumptini+oncall since we by-default own them).\n\nMight be good to replace jinrongwu@, zubinpratap@ and ashpakov@ with alvinjia@ since all the former are out or gone but check with him first how EngProd want to handle that.",
