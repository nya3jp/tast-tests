      "message": "I think it is better to initialize the reader somehow,\nwhich may be independent from instantiation of the reader, though.\n\nas for crrev.com/i/4150435, IIUC your goal is to share the reader crossing tests.\nThus, conceptually, the environment that the fixture provides should set up crosvm, right? (otherwise, carrying logreader looks confusing).\n\nSo, I expect that VM is set up at the end of SetUp(), and then log reader should be initialized later.\n\nIf, crosvm set-up is done outside of the fixture env,\ncarrying the logreader looks weird, because it also means to carry crosvm.\nSo, instead, as recommended in the CL, defer + function (and resetting vm somehow) is needed for isolated enviornment?\n\nWhich situation do you trying to make?",
