      "message": "I see that some of this was sort of asked before, but I didn\u0027t see a satisfying answer: is there any plan to address all these limitations? As-is, you\u0027re going to just fail this test on 99% of devices. (Particularly, they\u0027re almost all guaranteed to be missing #3.) You\u0027d probably do better to add the \"wilco\" dependency as already suggested, and not pretend that this feature is supported anywhere else yet.\n\nAnd as a practical matter: even if Tast gets some kind of \"hardware dependency\" support, I doubt anyone is going to bother labeling detailed properties about each attached USB adapter, which makes this intractable.\n\nI\u0027d really like to see this point somewhere useful (e.g., TODO(crbug/xxxx), with clear ownership and/or intended steps to unblock this), or else this test is just going to languish in \"informational\" status.",
