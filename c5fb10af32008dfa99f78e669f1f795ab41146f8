So, actually it does not encapsulate the lacros from callers, I think.\n\nIn addition, callers have to understand what fixtvalue can be passed here, which depends on ChromeType param. Specifically, if ChromeType is Lacros, the fixture must be the one of the lacros fixtures.\n\nThus, I still think we should use lacros.Setup/CloseLacrosChrome instead of this at least at this moment. If you have more thoughts, please let me know. If further discussion is needed, maybe VC works better than gerrit, I think.",
