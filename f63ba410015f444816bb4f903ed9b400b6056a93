      "message": "The tested functionality is closely related from a user\u0027s perspective, but the tested code is less closely related. My proposed tests check for a bug in overview code, whereas arc.SplitView seems more like a test of split view code and maybe ARC code. I just do not see any useful way to combine the tests.",

      "message": "Okay, I see what\u0027s different, but I\u0027m afraid that doesn\u0027t justify this as a separate test case here.\n\nRather, it looks like the existing arc.SplitView isn\u0027t enough -- it uses Snap event to cause splitview, but that is slightly different from the actual splitview UX IIRC. I would suggest to rewrite the entire arc.SplitView so that it also checks your condition (overview on the other side if 1 app window exists) in addition to the existing ones (2 apps splitview, swap). We should ask tetsui@ probably.",
