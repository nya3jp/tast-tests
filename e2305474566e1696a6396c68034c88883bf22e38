      "message": "non-blocking: but perhaps encoding this at a lower image quality would help (in general). \"Large file\" behaviour isn\u0027t interesting for these tests, and we don\u0027t need a file that\u0027s 1.36MB to get the same coverage. Reducing the size with a lower-quality JPEG encode could help us stay on top of filesystem flakes better, or just make the test faster in general which is nice too.",
