      "message": "non-blocking: but perhaps encoding this at a lower image quality would help (in general). \"Large file\" behaviour isn\u0027t interesting for these tests, and we don\u0027t need a file that\u0027s 1.36MB to get the same coverage. Reducing the size with a lower-quality JPEG encode could help us stay on top of filesystem flakes better, or just make the test faster in general which is nice too.",

However, the image is removed in the defer function os.Remove(localFileLocation).\n\nIn LaunchGalleryNotification, it downloads the image from notification and name it automatically. For unknown reason (I guess it is because this test has not removed the file from disk), the download names the file with suffix (1). \n\nThe retry used here is to copy the test file from linux user to CrOS user home.
