      "message": "I believe it would, the regression was not necessarily linked to launching it from the Settings app, just launching it in general. We chose the Settings app to automate as it\u0027s one of the natural points of entry for users and it\u0027s convenient to access for automation. Hard to say for sure, though, since I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a clear way to reproduce the issue. However the UI element to launch the app is hooked up to the same JS method I\u0027m calling here though, so it seemed like it should be okay.",
