      "message": "https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#package-names\n\nPackage name \"util\" sounds too generic. (indeed it is under chromium/tast/local/bundles/cros/session, but it is used as \"util\").\n\nHow about just moving to ownership package?\nIt looks like PrepareChromeForTesting is something for policy, so IMHO, that\u0027s ok. WDYT?",

      "message": "Done. I\u0027m not the owner, so I don\u0027t have a strong opinion. FWIW, in my way of thinking, ownership and policy are two separate things, so I find putting policy code into ownership.go a bit unintuitive. E.g. Device/UserPolicyDescriptor really belongs to sm.StorePolicyEx. I would also expect ownership.go to be used by Ownership* tests only, but that\u0027s not the case.",
