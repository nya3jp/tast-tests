      "message": "That CL adds more extensions to the allowlist, however I think we\u0027re going to need to change txt to something else (we could use .diff if you prefer) as txt is probably used by log files which should be trimmed by shrink_file_throttler.py. The other option if space is a concern is to modify the tast tests to not store the diff file to the results folder as it can be generated from the output file and the golden file after the fact. I think that\u0027s a better option actually.",
