      "message": "I would keep benchmark mode setup here, otherwise it will be ran multiple times.\n\nI\u0027m currently working on CL ccrev.com/c/1662965 that reworks benchmark mode a bit. I also identified multiple causes of the high CPU usage, some of which are tackled in crrev.com/c/1666577.\n\nIt\u0027s definitely a good idea to wait for idle CPU after logging in, in \u0027webRTCDecodePerf\u0027. You can call \u0027WaitForIdle\u0027 manually.\n\nMaybe we could completely split off \u0027WaitForIdle\u0027 from SetupBenchmark. WDYT?",
