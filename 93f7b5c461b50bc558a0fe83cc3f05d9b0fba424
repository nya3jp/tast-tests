      "message": "Couple of comments:\n\nThe BUG talks about \"audio related tast tests\", but this code is\nin the graphics category. It should be in the audio category, \nright?  I\u0027m afraid that graphics is the wrong category: this \ntest will not be actively monitored, might break and likely \nbitrot (there\u0027s a number of such ad-hoc tests that suffered \na similar fate e.g. ytvimeowebgl).  I would suggest landing \nit in the ui/videocuj/ category with its peers?\n\nThen perhaps more fundamental question: What exactly is the goal\nof the test? Check the audio routing or verify there\u0027s no frame \ndrops? I cannot comment on the former, but re. the latter, we\u0027re \ngoing to be at odds with YT DASH algorithm: tabs in the background\nwill stop playing video, specially on low powered devices, and \nwe\u0027ll likely see dropped frames when alt-tabing into those while \nvideo playback resumes -- this would not be a bug, and even if \nit were, what\u0027d be expected action? Maybe file bugs against \nYouTube?  Moreover,  depending on the device, YT DASH will change\nresolutions up and down adjusting to what it considers the optimal\nresolution for the device, and might drop frames until it finds\nit. Again, that wouldn\u0027t be a bug per se.",
