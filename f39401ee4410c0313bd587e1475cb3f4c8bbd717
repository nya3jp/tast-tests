Increasing the timeout to 40 secs makes the test to pass consistently, however, we should still investigate why the detection time increased b/256740412\n\nThis patch is supposed to make PMKSA caching more robust by explicitly roaming the device through dbus command, so it is not affected by bug such as b/256740412.

The reason I had  b/256740412, was because I was planning to improve this test and then focus getting the fix in b/256740412. Given that we should not be merging this, until we have coverage in RoamAPGone, we dupe both to one.\n\nI will mark this CL as WIP to get coverage on RoamAPGone first and then revive this CL.",
