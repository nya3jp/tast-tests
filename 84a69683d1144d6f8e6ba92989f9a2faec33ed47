      "message": "I think remaining battery capacity + energy before the test starts would always be helpful. (We could have a potential problem when the battery is worn out and stops giving sufficient voltage even when it\u0027s above the `power.LowBatteryShutdownPercent()`.)\n\nAdded logic to fail the tests by looking at the `lowBatteryMargin`, since it\u0027s already provided for all the tests. If you\u0027re ok with this I guess it\u0027d be best to rename it to `expectedMaxCapacityDischarge`.\n\nI tested the battery drain on my nami DUT and it discharged less than 1% when running test for 5 minutes with 100% CPU use. Default `lowBatteryMargin` value is 2%.",
