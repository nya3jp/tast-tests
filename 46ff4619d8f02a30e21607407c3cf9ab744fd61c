      "message": "I think it\u0027s OK to move lacros/memory_stress.go to platform/memory_stress_lacros.go . I think the difference between lacros/memory_stress.go and platform/memory_stress_basic.go is big enough that it\u0027s clearer to have a separate test than adding a few if statements in platform/memory_stress_basic.go.\n\nHidehiko, what do you think?",

      "message": "Quick question - why do we want the tests to be so different between lacros and ash-chrome?\n\nIn general, IMO we should have either all lacros variations in a lacros package, or all variations next to their original tests, not mixed. And out of those two options, having variations next to their original tests seems better to me.\n\nSorry to raise this after you\u0027ve already done the work. Keen to hear from hidehiko@ as well on this.",
