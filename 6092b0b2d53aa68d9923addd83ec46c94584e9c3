What a user would really care about is the logical name, I think, like your \u0027qualcommAtherosQCA6174\u0027 and similar definitions. Shouldn\u0027t *those* be the public-facing interface? And all of these fields should be private, I think.\n\n(If you want to do things like wlan_driver.go\u0027s logBandwidthSupport(), you should just provide a helper that accepts a DevInfo and can extract the feature info, returning a bandwidth type or similar.)",
