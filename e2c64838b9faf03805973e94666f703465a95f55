      "message": "There are few issues with these functions:\n\n1. all these functions looks useless, you can just simply put their body into test function \n\n2, they accept testing.State and don\u0027t return error. In Go there is common pattern to return error which is always preferred, so caller should decide what to do with error -- ignore / report as error / report as fatal. Also imagine that checkPulseDevices will report fatal, how you will understand in which option it failed? Such functions should return error and caller must add more context in logs, so it\u0027ll be clear when exactly it happened and who was the caller.",
