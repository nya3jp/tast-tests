We shouldn\u0027t change the behavior for ash/lacros. We shouldn\u0027t introduce a method just to make a code look \"similar\".\n\nIf we\u0027d introduce Browser.Close(), we should come up with the clear common semantics regardless of lacros/ash. We didn\u0027t introduce it, because we didn\u0027t come up with the clear semantics unfortunately.",

      "message": "The intention is that (Browser).Close doesn\u0027t really change any functional behaviors for ash-chrome and lacros-chrome on purpose as you and I are concerned, but provide a consistent API that does the same as today.\n\nExample (as you see in this CL) users may expect as below\n```\ncr :\u003d chrome.New(...)\nbr, ... :\u003d browserfixt.SetUp(...)\ndefer br.Close()  # cleanup browser part of ash-chrome or lacros-chrome. same as closerBrowser\ndefer cr.Close()  # cleanup non-browser part of ash-chrome\n```\n\nWhen it comes to implementation, Chrome and Lacros should know how to close itself, so should be able to pass a Closer into Browser when instantiating Browser.\nHowever, since it is inherently a cosmetic change on API, I\u0027m open to any suggestion. Please feel free to advise.",
