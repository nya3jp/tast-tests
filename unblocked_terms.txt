# This is the local list of words which are still too commonly used in the
# codebase to be blocked outright. This list will continue to shrink as the
# codebase moves away from the use of these terms.
#
#
# Don't delete this file if you want to keep keyword_check enabled even if it's
# empty.
#
# See repohooks/README.md for more details.
#
# !!! READ FIRST !!!
#
# When updating this file, make sure to update go/tast-coil-status.
#
# Some of the terms may be unblocked even so some of the are still
# present in the code base because they are in files sourced from
# third party or from a file where the term can not be modified.
#
# When a blocked term is used because it can not be replaced
#  1. Make sure to explicitly state the reason in the commit message.
#  2. Update go/tast-coild-status with an explanation of why
#     the term is included.
#  3. Add "see go/tast-coil-status for known use cases" below the
#     unblocked term.
#
# All unblocked terms should have a bug associated with them.
# All blocked terms should be 'clean" if all terms have been removed.
#  OR have a bug associated with them and a reference to go/tast-coil-status
