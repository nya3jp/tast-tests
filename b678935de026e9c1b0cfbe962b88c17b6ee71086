We should probably fix the documentation, but we should also be more stringent here, and make sure we\u0027re actually in a connected/associated state.\n\nBTW, you can easily see this with something like this:\n\n ### get fresh scan results\n /usr/local/lib/flimflam/test/start-scanning wifi\n ### wait a bit, then:\n connectivity show Services | grep \u0027WiFi\\.BSSID\u0027\n\nYou\u0027ll see plenty of non-connected networks reporting this property, if you\u0027re in open air.",
