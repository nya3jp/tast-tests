      "message": "It seems like we might want another input here, something like `optionName`. If I\u0027m understanding the checked/unchecked/mixed states correctly, it seems like this function currently either selects or unselects every option in the checkbox at once. I think what we\u0027re really after is a function that can manipulate a single option in the checkbox. Is this feasible?\n\nEither that or I\u0027m not understanding this completely. What does it mean to left click an entire checkbox?",
