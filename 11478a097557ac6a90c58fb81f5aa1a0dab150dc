We probably will never enable this feature on _all_ devices, but for those that do, we want to test it just the same as any other functional test -- i.e., wifi_matfunc.\n\nBut that\u0027s just my opinion.\n\nI guess if we really decide that this feature is not on par with other features, then maybe that\u0027s a reason to isolate it somewhere else.",
