      "message": "I think the SoftwareDep (or Hardware dep? it\u0027s not clear to me yet) is the main key. We probably will never enable this feature on _all_ devices, but for those that do, we want to test it just the same as any other functional test -- i.e., wifi_matfunc.\n\nBut that\u0027s just my opinion.\n\nI guess if we really decide that this feature is not on par with other features, then maybe that\u0027s a reason to isolate it somewhere else.",

(I guess we might need both when we also want to informationally check WoWiFi of different chips)\n\nOTOH, I think wificell setup is enough for these tests ( I\u0027ll need servo in the remaining tests, but it\u0027s available in wificell as well), so for now, we don\u0027t really need a new suite.\n\nRemove this TODO.",
