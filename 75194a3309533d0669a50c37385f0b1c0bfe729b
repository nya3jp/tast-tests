QR code detection\n\nDo you think we can have a variable (e.g. StreamingCondition) and split measureStreamingPerformance() into three parts:\n1. Pre-process\n2. Measuring (including stabilization, measuring and saving metrics)\n3. Post-Process\n\nAnd do the pre-process and post-process for each use cases respectively:\n[Preprocess]\n1. Preview -\u003e Switch to photo mode\n2. Recording -\u003e Switch to video mode and start recording\n3.
