Personalization test code relies heavily on uiauto.Action, and I didn\u0027t want to modify all call sites of `OpenPersonalizationHub` to also pass along a `tconn` when it was already present in `uiauto.Context`.\n\nis this acceptable, or are there other suggestions for mixing the SWA code with `uiauto.Action` in a better way?",
