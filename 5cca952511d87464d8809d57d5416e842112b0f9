      "message": "This cleanup is shared between two methods: `s.Close` and `faillog.DumpUITreeAndScreenshot` .\n`s.Close` in the worst case will take about 15 seconds (default configuration) looking for an element and likely short time to execute a chrome API.\nI don\u0027t have an estimate for `faillog.DumpUITreeAndScreenshot` duration and it seems to be barely used in the codebase. However, a similar method `faillog.DumpUITreeWithScreenshotOnError` is usually called with a 1 minute cleanup context. I thought, it was unlikely, that both cleanup methods would time out, so I picked the largest of the two.\n\nWhat would be the usual practice for picking cleanup context duration in tast?",
