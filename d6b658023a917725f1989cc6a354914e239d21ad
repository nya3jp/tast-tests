      "message": "Why not having time.Hours already in the stressHours variable? Also you could rename variable to stressDuration and that way you will be parameterized the test to whatever duration you want (minutes, hours, days) and with the first suggestion the variable\u0027s name won\u0027t contain the the unit (Hours) as it does now.\n\nWDYT?",
