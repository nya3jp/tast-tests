I also intend that ideally, this special argument is something we don\u0027t to force users to use forever (auto-determination would be a nice to have).\n\nFrom the test writer\u0027s perspective, they should specify the scope of what router types are supported. I have modified the behavior of some of the remote tests in the parent cl to do some router type checking. However, I have not included the means to actually pass in a different router type via tast arguments to cause it to fail yet.",
