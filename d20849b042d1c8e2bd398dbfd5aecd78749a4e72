      "message": "Can we get this from the pageobject struct tags instead?  It would be good to find a way to do this such that there is no need for the ctx/tconn/error.\n\nOther things I was considering were storing the findparams on Action or NodeRef so that we could have a dialog.WaitUntilGone(), but there were other problems with this approach.  Another possibility would be uig.WaitUntilGone(graph *action) that would execute the graph until a not found error was returned.",
