This particular test has surfaced a P1 bug (crbug.com/1112698) previously which was not reproducible in my Ubuntu setup, it was to do with the way samba was resolving DNS and the penguin.linux.test DNS hostnames. For this alone it would be nice to maintain the test as a regression for this issue.",
