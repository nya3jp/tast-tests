      "message": "Xibin Liu:\n\u003e We did see this being generated by Ash when camera app is used. So probably we still want to keep this in Common if you moving the other two to browser.\n\n\nXiyuan Xia:\n\u003e It is likely because camera app runs as part of ash-chrome, regardless of whether lacros-chrome is enabled or not. In this case, it make sense to put it under ash metrics. But for other cases (non system web app), it is a browser metric.\n\nWe can either keep it as a browser metric only, or collect it from all sources and make analysis side to decide. But they are probably not ready for that yet,\nso maybe we should add it to Ash in a few tests manually.",
