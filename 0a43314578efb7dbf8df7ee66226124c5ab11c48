      "message": "Just wanted to circle back to this. Mostly we have been working with \"ectool temps all\" to get an idea of the temperatures. But I think those are slower/not CPU temperatures? They can tell us if the system is relatively warm. There is some autotest code to guess is_system_thermally_throttled() that should tell us about the current state.\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/autotest/+/master/client/bin/utils.py#1538\n\nWhat also interests me a lot is how much higher the temperatures are after a test than before. Ideally a perf test cools(!) a device. Now obviously most don\u0027t. But the problem is how does one know when it overheated? If it did, random numbers again. That is more of a load/stress test than a microbenchmark.",
