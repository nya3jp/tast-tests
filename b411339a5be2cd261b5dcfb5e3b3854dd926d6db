Please update the comment for this.\n\nI\u0027m not really sure what you mean here. There isn\u0027t really a subsequent \"timeout\", but there is a potential next step -- the comment at line 164. So \"first 60 seconds\" seems like a perfectly fine characterization to me.\n\nIf you want this comment written differently, please spell it out, and I (or you) can submit a follow-up.",
