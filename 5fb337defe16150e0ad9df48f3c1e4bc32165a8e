      "message": "Is this accurate?  Two things stick out: BootMode is a string.  We should think a bit about what DUT state is, as well (i.e. do we mean the firmware concept of mode here).  What about: \"BootMode is a string of the possible DUT firmware modes.  It is intended to be used with the set off constants that are defined in this package as well.\"?",

      "message": "It seems odd to me that the BootModes are just strings.  Suspect there may be a better way to represent state, but looking at this change as a delta this seems reasonable.  Optional (outside the scope of this change): consider thinking about something like what\u0027s described at  https://golangbyexample.com/state-design-pattern-go/.  Perhaps it will lend itself to enforcing not exposing any state transitions that are not intended to be exposed to test authors.",
