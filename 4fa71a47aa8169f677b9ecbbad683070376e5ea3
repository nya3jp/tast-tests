I tested this by running\n\n    tast --verbose run localhost:7777 bluetooth.*.floss_disabled\n\nand ensuring all of the tests passed. I think this is in better shape and is no longer just an example and can be fully reviewed so that it can be landed :) please let me know if y\u0027all have any questions!",
