      "message": "The motivation of this change is that the ending message \"Wait for idle CPU took 1s\" looks misleading. We actually spend 12+1s waiting for idle CPU. So I moved the ending message a level up (to cpu.WaintUntilIdle()).\nThe starting message provides the reason why \"Waiting up to 12s...\" runs and why it may run multiple times.",
