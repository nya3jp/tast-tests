      "message": "I believe there are a couple points:\n1. Having uniformly collected data helps the dashboard team greatly, since each test collects a uniform set of metrics, and there are fewer \"special cases\" per test.\n2. Something as common as desk activation smoothness appears to be a pretty standard metric that\u0027s not inherently unique to DesksCUJ. DesksCUJ happens to revolve around desk moving, but as a common action that users do, opening Desks is a task that could easily be applied to other (future) CUJs.\n3. There\u0027s no inherent downside to having the metric in common_metrics.go, since results-chart.json filters out all 0 values. \n\nIMO, CUJ tests that have pretty specific metrics related to unique actions in the test that would be unlikely for future tests to reproduce, like `Cras.MissedCallbackFrequencyInput` and `Cras.MissedCallbackFrequencyOutput` in MeetCUJ could be added directly to the test. But then again, I feel like there\u0027s a valid argument to add it to `common_metrics.go` anyways, because it costs nothing, and ensures if another test happens to do something that triggers this metric, we collect it.",
