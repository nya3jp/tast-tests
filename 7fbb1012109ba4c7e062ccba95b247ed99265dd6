      "message": "Hello Jeremy,\n\nAt the moment, in order to better understand whether keyboard is blocked in tablet mode, I thought it might be useful to also have the keyboard state from EC printed to the logs. \n\nAlso, I\u0027m still trying to find similarities/reasons for those models that had keyboards picked up by evtest in tablet mode. I\u0027ve parameterized this test such that these models are skipped and treated as the corner cases.",
