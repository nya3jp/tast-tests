Just abandoning the old URI support and making the test informational might be better as it\u0027s simpler, although the test will be broken for a while.\nIf we keep the old URI support, then it might be more natural to keep the test critical. It should be safe, since Android side changes for switching to the new URIs will be blocked by this test, which guarantees that this test won\u0027t be broken by the changes.",
