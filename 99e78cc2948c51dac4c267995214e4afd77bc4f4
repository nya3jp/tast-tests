      "message": "Ack. It\u0027s not the same because vars are only defined in the scope that they are declared in. If I create a new ht with a definition (:\u003d), then that ht is visible only to the scope of the if else (these are separately scoped in golang). If I don\u0027t use a declaration, I could leverage ht from the parent context, but I\u0027d also have to declare \"ok\" outside of that context as well. If I did ht, ok :\u003d ..., I would get a variable is not used error.",
