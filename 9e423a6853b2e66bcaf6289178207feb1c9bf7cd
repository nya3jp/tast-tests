      "message": "This CL is a simpler version of crrev.com/c/3332755 and it only covers camerabox and policy packages. Tried the dry run and it could passed most of CQ tests (https://screenshot.googleplex.com/BQvMy5oHaSjvq9k.png), so I think this CL is sufficient to the main CL (crrev.com/c/3252922).\n\nThus, I will try to merge this CL with the main CL first. If it works, I will merge the larger one (crrev.com/c/3332755) to cover other packages under /tast.",
