Note that on one of the earlier CLs, it wasn\u0027t clear you *really* need to re-start the UI job when you\u0027re done (which I\u0027m guessing is a significant chunk of time?) -- it depends on\n(a) whether we want to be nice to the user afterward (e.g., not leaving them a black screen) and\n(b) tests that require Chrome always start it back up correctly (I believe they do?)\n\nAnyway, this is more of a curiosity than a requirement. Any savings is likely a good thing, as long as it doesn\u0027t have other large downsides.",
