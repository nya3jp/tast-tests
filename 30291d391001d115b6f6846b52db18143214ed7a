      "message": "I used `LeftClickUntil()` here because simply left clicking a single time wasn\u0027t working. I experimented a bit, and doing two `LeftClick`s in a row does work, so I think there\u0027s a short moment after dragging to holding space where the tray is not clickable. Since the mouse is already on top of the exact location of the tray, the click happens immediately after the release of the drag. Not sure if this has anything to do with the animation crash we were seeing before.\n\nThis works for now, but I was thinking of looking into why it isn\u0027t working the first time. Let me know your thoughts, and I\u0027ll start probing into this.",
