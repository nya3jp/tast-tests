Looking at the pattern of failures you may be able to get it high enough by excluding certain boards/models.\n\nSee Crostini tast tests for how these have been split into stable/unstable tests, with stable boards marked critical, and unstable boards informational.\n\nIt looks like there are several boards that are 100% passing, so this is probably a good approach here.",

      "message": "Thanks Matthew. Could you point me to specific test where this was done, as an example I can follow?\n\nI\u0027m happy to keep this informational on boards that we know have suspect TCPCs (so it will never be 100% on them).\n\n\u003e Looking at the pattern of failures you may be able to get it high enough by excluding certain boards/models.\n\nMay I ask, what is \"high enough\"? Is it just 100%? Or is there some case-by-case wiggle room?",
