      "message": "Just to check, why do we need this? Is it because we have a hierarchy of having YAML files per test [directory], and then relatively short content in the expectations YAMLs themselves? If so, I\u0027m a bit hesitant to generate that many expectations files --- it seems easier (both on the file system and to parse) to have a bit larger granularity, with longer expectations files.\n\nIn particular, perhaps we have model/board/chipset YAMLs, containing the expectations for the corresponding failing/flaky tests. I recognize the issue boils down to how we slice, basically, and I think that having tests as the lowest level might actually be a bit easier to manage. Thoughts?",
