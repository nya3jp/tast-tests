      "message": "This feels a bit vague to me. Is the emphasis on \"successful\" or on \"completed\"? Because you might get errors just because we didn\u0027t even try the action (pcap failed to start), and we also can get errors because action ran (and completed) but failed. Both of these give you \u0027false\u0027 right now.\n\nIIUC, the only differentiating case (i.e., different than \u0027err \u003d\u003d nil\u0027) is when the action completes successfully but closing the pcap fails. Is this a useful property? I guess it happens to help with one thing you\u0027re doing in this test, but it feels a little off.\n\nSorry if I\u0027m missing something or have bad taste; but this feels like a function that wants to be very general, but isn\u0027t. Or maybe it\u0027s OK and just the comment needs tweaked.",
