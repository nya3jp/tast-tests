      "message": "Is there a reason why you have this inside the poll loop?\n\nA probably better way to do this would be to use one of the following things:\n\n1. use something like \u003clayout android:defaultHeight\u003d\"400dp\" android:defaultWidth\u003d\"600dp\"\u003e\n   in your manifest file for an activity.\n2. If I remember correctly (might be wrong here) you can use\n   \u003cmeta-data android:name\u003d\"WindowManagerPreference:FreeformWindowSize\" android:value\u003d\"phone\" /\u003e \n   inside the manifest file for a new activity.\n3. Start the activity with ActivityOptions.setLaunchBounds(...) - you would need to check how \n   to do that with the tast testing framework\n\nAs in this case you are coming up WindowStateNormal and you can skip this altogether.",

      "message": "Thanks for you advice. Setting this poll loop because considering there are lots of subtest in this test file. I\u0027m going to keep it independent, which means I want make sure the window in the normal state wherever the test running (other test maybe changed the window state).\n\nActually, it may need some function like \"set window bound\" to make sure the window located in a suitable position. I\u0027m going to add it have finish the setWindowBound function test.",
