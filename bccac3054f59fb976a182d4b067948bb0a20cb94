      "message": "I gave this a little more thought, and IMO I think this is pretty redundant when we already use the ExpectShillProperty stream. Instead, I think a better/more efficient implementation would be to optionally pass in an additional list of properties to ExpectShillProperty for monitoring, and return a list of PropertyChanged signals for those properties that we would collect over the lifetime of the PropertyWatcher. This way, we would just stop monitoring when we finish waiting, and we wouldn\u0027t have to rely on the hack you currently use.\n\nYen-lin suggested something similar below, and this also wouldn\u0027t catch the disconnect case in which there was no PropertyChanged signal, but I don\u0027t think that really matters (AssertNoDisconnect relies on the disconnect event anyway, so if the device were already disconnected, AssertNoDisconnect wouldn\u0027t catch that either).\n\nI\u0027m currently working on something that might need this monitor functionality, so I might take a stab at this myself if you don\u0027t mind (and if others agree on the proposed idea).",

      "message": "The design might depend on the real usage, but as ExpectShillProperty is getting more complicated, I have a thought: Might it be cleaner we use some bidirectional stream gRPC to achieve something general like a remote version of PropertyWatcher.Wait(All)? Then we can move the detailed monitoring logic in remote codes for each usages instead of packing them all in one gRPC.\n\nHsin-chen and I discussed about this before, but we dropped the design for two reasons:\n1. gRPC does not have a \u0027interface{}\u0027 type for arbitrary data. We\u0027ll have to marshal it ourselves (some logics now in ShillVal type) and we don\u0027t really want to handle complex reflection for the types that we might never use, e.g. nested map/slice.\n2. the test runtime might increase much if we have high network latency (e.g. connecting DUT in lab) as there are much more RTT.\n\nDo you think this might help in your use case?",

      "message": "Hmm..., this looks a little hacky. In particular, it sends a fake PropertyChanged on the same interface/path as the real service. It sounds like a bad idea to me. If we want to send a dbus signal, I might prefer going back with raw dbus SignalWatcher in this function so that we can add a Match for the custom \"stop\" signal. And perhaps extract a signal parsing function to share with Wait().\n\nFWIW, one thought I had for handling \"no disconnection\" is adding a \"monitor\" CheckMethod in ExpectShillProperty which watches some properties before the next event is caught. Then you\u0027ll have a clear boundary of \"monitor\". However, this can\u0027t handle the case like general AssertNoDisconnect as there might be no property change. So, the current direction also looks good to me.",
