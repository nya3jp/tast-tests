      "message": "Why do we need to avoid logs like this as they could be useful sometimes. Also this could make test-writers even more confused which one to use (e.g. when/why do they need to log?). Otherwise, there are other cases we need to provide options for users to turn on/off the logs, which is complicated.\n\nI am not sure about this, +Matt to review.",

      "message": "Ye, actually this is a historical reason that when uiauto was introduced, some reviewers suggested to use retry rather than polling. For some use cases such as `waiting until text change after press a key`, it always retries. e.g. \n\nRetry failed attempt 1: failed to validate input value: got: 今日は; want: こんにちは (ignoring case)\n2021-10-13T05:57:23.559101Z [05:57:23.513] Retry failed attempt 2: failed to validate input value: got: 今日は; want: こんにちは (ignoring case)\n2021-10-13T05:57:24.583457Z [05:57:24.538] Retry succeed in attempt 3\n\nIf we play a trick to use retry as a simplified version of polling (less code), we just want it to repeatedly check without any log.",
