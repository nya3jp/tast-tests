      "message": "Hello Jeremy,\n\nThis change addresses issues found on Hayato/Asurada and Kakadu/Kukui. Namely, the display would sometimes not get turned on/off as expected. Adding a one second sleep after power press would increase stability, allowing the test to pass almost always. Also, I have used an EC command instead to set tablet mode, which is much easier than parsing regular expression.",
