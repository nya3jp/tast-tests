If it is using Termina, can you please make sure it is using the Termina image under test?  ie the one in the artifacts.  There is code in vm/images.go to help locate and extract these images if necessary.\n\nPerhaps you can make a precondition to extract the images, so that it doesn\u0027t need to be repeated for both this and the other test.",
