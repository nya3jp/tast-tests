Or, success with empty result?\nIt looks a bit complicated to me. Could you mention what\u0027s the expected behavior in the document?",

      "message": "Thanks, your questions made me think more carefully about this function...\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1) We always want to return an error, regardless of whether we get responses or not.\n2) I don\u0027t have 100% preference, but in general I want to treat negative timeouts as the zero timeout.\n\nThis is because \"timeout\" is to allow some time to peer services to respond.\n\nAlso I noticed that this patchset does not support context cancellation (instead of context deadline).\n\nSo I decided to check ctx.Done() while reading responses.",
