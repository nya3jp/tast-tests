      "message": "There is a case that the actual elapsed time of L690-L701 is slightly shorter than TimerDelay, but delay can be slightly longer than TimerDelay. So, it could be possibly false-positive.\n\nIs it intended? Any alternatives to avoid that false-positive ness?\nIf so, could you explicitly document it?",
