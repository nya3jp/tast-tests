So, it could be possibly false-positive.\n\nIs it intended? Any alternatives to avoid that false-positive ness?\nIf so, could you explicitly document it?",

      "message": "Let\u0027s say TimerDelay is 3 secs. Also, it is expected L690-L701 takes 3 secs (or longer for overhead).\n\nAnd let\u0027s consider the case where, WaitForState at L699 resumed before 3 secs, e.g., 2.99 secs.\nMy understanding is, the condition of L703 becomes \"true\". However, because there takes time to compare \"timerState \u003d\u003d TimerOn\" and \"time.Now()\", time.Now() may return the timestamp later than 3 secs. So, it accidentally \"NOT\" returns an error.\nI.e., even if the failure case, it may report a success.\nQ1: is it expected/intended?\nQ2: If so, could you explicitly comment that there\u0027s cases that this cannot capture failures.",
