      "message": "What feature are you referring to here? We wouldn\u0027t add a kiosk verifier, that doesn\u0027t actually make sense (as outlined above).\n\nI think you can argue that there\u0027s no point in having a test that just verifies that this doesn\u0027t work, but given the whole bug we went through with this (thinking it should work and then realizing it shouldn\u0027t) I can also see some value in having something that explicitly says that this isn\u0027t supposed to work and verifies that this is the case. If someone does try and add a kiosk verifier later they\u0027ll at least have to deal with this test case and produce a good answer for why their design actually makes sense.\n\nThat said if it\u0027s generally agreed that this test isn\u0027t worthwhile I can just drop it, but I do think there\u0027s a bit of value of explicitly covering this use case with _something_.",
