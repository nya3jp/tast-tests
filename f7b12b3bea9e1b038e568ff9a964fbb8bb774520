      "message": "[drive by, as I saw this CL referred from another bug about the existing Autotest]\n\ndid anybody send this by anyone on the power team? seems like the suspend/resume logic is something others are going to want, and it would be nice to have a single way of doing this for tests. I\u0027m also not sure if all the logic around the RTC is really all that necessary still -- it\u0027s possible this was an overengineered leftover from Autotest.",
