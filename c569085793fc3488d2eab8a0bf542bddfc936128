      "message": "Per discussion on the design doc (go/cros-camera:dd:calculate-cca-test-coverage) with Shik, using an environment variable would make it easier to set/clean the flag rather than using a file. \n\nAn alternative is passing variables to the tests to determine if it should measure the coverage. However, since we used local_test_runner to run these tests, currently local_test_runner does not support passing variables feature. As a result, we choose to use environment variable as the flag at this moment.",
