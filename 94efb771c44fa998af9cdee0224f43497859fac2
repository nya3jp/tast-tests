      "message": "Currently only |captureConfirmAndDone| and |closeApp| checks for test app result, which should return RESULT_OK and RESULT_CANCELED respectively. Since I think the original logic makes it harder to understand what the expected result should be, I just simplified it. But I am also okay if others think the original logic is more extendible and want to keep it.\n\nShik/Inker, do you think such change is okay or should we keep the original condition?",
