      "message": "This is a note that intuitively, rather than separating power_4p, it might be good enough to bring the same data points to existing test cases.  Can I ask why you want to create new subtests?\n\nI guess the reason whould be, those power tests want setup.PowerTest which disables several services (like bluetooth / wifi) to reduce the possible noises from the results, while we want to keep those services for our CUJ tests as they\u0027re a part of the realistic user environment. Or do we have any other reasons?",
