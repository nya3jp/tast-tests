      "message": "The way I see is.. remote tests can do orchestration work (eg, like you said resetting `cr` when browser type changed or error handling), while local services can just provide APIs that do one specific action at a time upon a request of the remote tests (actions like new, open, close)\n\nSpecifically for ECVerifyVK that is the only caller of this service by far, it has a setup implementation to ensure clean start by a hard power reset per each browser and also implements a reset function in test when needed (http://cs/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/remote/bundles/cros/firmware/ec_verify_vk.go?l\u003d275)\nGiven that I think the test is unlikely failing by that assumption. Is it okay to move on for the initial check-in? PTAL.",
