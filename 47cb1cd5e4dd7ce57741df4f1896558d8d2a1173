      "message": "The review that added the check I copied is here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/1497732/ (This is also the only other user of LoadComponent outside of the vm tests currently.)\n\nThe discussion there makes it sound like checking at the call site was preferred. However, it seems to me that returning an error from inside LoadComponent when Mount is requested and the returned path is empty would be reasonable and would still accomplish what I assume was the intent of the original review comment, allowing non-Mount LoadComponent calls to return an empty string.\n\n(I don\u0027t totally understand why the component updater service considers this a non-error condition, though - working around it on the client side seems a bit odd.)",
