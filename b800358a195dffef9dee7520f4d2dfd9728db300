Is it possible to inherit a precondition?\n**(From what I\u0027ve read I think its currently not possible for pre but possible for fixture)\n\nIt does not really make sense to have this for multivm, since the package does not have anything to do with DNS. Would it be better to rewrite a new precondition for DNS proxy?\n\nAlso, the install command with skip the installation if \u0027dig\u0027 is installed, so currently, it will be skipped with the current precondition.",
