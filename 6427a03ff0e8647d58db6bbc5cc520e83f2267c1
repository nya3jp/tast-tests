      "message": "This is not necessarily blocking this CL, but is about naming up for discussion. We have seen various tconn variables defined for each source in different contexts: tconn, ctconn, ltconn, bTconn.\n\nIn particular, `tconn` might have been used confusingly with lacros. Here it\u0027s for the browser with ctconn for ash-chrome, while some uses it for ash-chrome along with bTconn for the browser.\nIt would be great to make it clear on when to use what and have it documented in the guideline doc for users to avoid confusion. Any thoughts?",

      "message": "The original convention is ctconn for ash and ltconn for lacros, and tconn for browser (either). I agree we should document it in the Tast docs and rename all the usages. What about:\n\nlacros: ltconn\nash: ctconn (or maybe atconn? but it looks like at conn so it\u0027s confusing)\neither: btconn\n\nIf people are gonna claim it should be bTconn, then they better also claim that tconn should be tConn, and bTconn should be bTConn lol (since it\u0027s TestConn not Testconn)\n\nhidehiko@, wdyt?",
