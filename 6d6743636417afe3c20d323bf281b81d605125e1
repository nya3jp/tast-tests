      "message": "This could skip tests in some cases unexpectedly, because whether checking codec impl is succeeded, and if checking codec impl is succeeded but it is not the expected one, are mixed.\n\n1) Could you change the function to return a pair of bool and err, meaning whether it has decoder, and if the check is succeeded?\n2) Stepping back, skipping test is strongly recommended to be avoided in Tast. Is it possible to check by using build time condition (software deps) etc.? if not, does hardware deps work, which will come sometime near future?",

      "message": "ToT has two parts: sw and, maybe, hw performance gathering. Following your \nadvice in the past, this CL just do one thing: force a codec that is \nsupported. This will allow unbreaking a test that is broken on ToT and has\nbeen so for a few days now.\n\nHowever, I agree that is a bit wasteful to have to launch Chrome, wait for\nCPU idle etc, to then skip metrics collection because e.g. hw decoding is not\nsupported. I think it\u0027s best to leave for another CL splitting the test into\ntwo, one sw and one hw where the latter could be gated by e.g. caps.HWDecodeH264\netc like the other webrtc tests:\nhttps://cs.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/webrtc/rtc_peer_connection_accel_used.go?dr\u003dCSs\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d55",
