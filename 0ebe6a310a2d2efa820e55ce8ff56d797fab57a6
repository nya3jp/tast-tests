      "message": "I wonder, does this really need to be in \u0027remote\u0027? I see similar use cases for local tests, where we start up, e.g., local hostapd instances (see my network.Ethernet8021x work; currently, I\u0027m just lazy and poll for startup via hostapd_cli instead, but I could also reuse this if that\u0027s preferred) or VPN servers (I don\u0027t know specifically if there is log-parsing readiness required there, but I could imagine so).\n\nAnd then, it might not live in the \u0027wificell\u0027 namespace at all.\n\nI only say \"I wonder\", because this is still a fairly use-case-specific helper library, and I\u0027m not sure the expectations on libraries for this sort of thing.",
