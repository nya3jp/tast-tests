      "message": "Hi Eliot,\n\nThis CL adds holdingspace.Screenshot and fixes holdingspace.Downloads.pin to be more robust since it was a trivial change and that test suite needed to be touched anyways due to changes in the uiauto/holdingspace api. If you feel strongly, I can separate the pin --\u003e pinAndUnpin change to a separate CL but since the change is trivial I wanted to avoid additional overhead of another review. Let me know what you think.\n\nThanks! :)\nDavid",
