      "message": "If enum type is not shared by more than one message, I think we should put it inline instead. Also, I have concern about exposing the low level API through GRPC service. I think we have seen UI delay issues to make tests flaky. I think it may be worse by using GRPC interface. I would suggest to support higher level operation such as Drag instead. The Drag request can be specified by node specification or position. We can even add an expected event in the request so that it can check before it return.\n\n",

      "message": "Agreed. I think there is still a lot of to be done and decided on how UIAuto should be exposed, primarily around coarse grained actions like Drag and composite action like Combined.  \nI started small and include the few core APIs which I felt was absolutely necessary. As Location() stability is already baked into those functions, it should help flakiness. Perhaps the client side would have to do more precondition check (e.g. WaitUntilExists after clicks) before next action.\nConcretely, is there a particular API in this list of 7 which you felt is too low level?",

I think the primary usage is to facilitate proto.(Un)marshal functions to converting between structs (generated by protoc) and the wire formats, whether it be json or binary. \n\nIt does not seem to directly benefit a struct to struct conversion. Although technically we could leverage json/binary as an intermediary, the benefit will be minimal because bulk of the manual conversion is between enum(on PB) to string (on uiAuto) which does require some logic instead of pure field mapping.",
