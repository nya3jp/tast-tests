I thought that a bug ID in comments + a local SkipOnModel list might be enough because we probably don\u0027t want to end up with one hwdep.XXX per known issue.\n\nIn any case, this change still looks good enough to me.",

      "message": "Agreed, since it\u0027s only 2 particular platforms I think the test itself can handle the list of platforms to skip instead of adding a full-blown hwdep. See for example how this test does it: http://source/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/wifi/check_intel_sar_table.go;rcl\u003df9961b5741d7b41be713aff82298eac3a8aff70d;l\u003d58\n\nThat\u0027s what I meant by:\n\u003e I think in that case, since it\u0027s for a specific feature, it makes sense for the test itself to list the limitation.\nbut that wasn\u0027t very clear :-( I should have made it a bit clearer, sorry!",
