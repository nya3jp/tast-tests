      "message": "Initialisms, such as IO for input/ouptut, should have a consistent case, per http://go/go-code-review-comments#Initialisms. This is even true for multiple adjacent initalisms, such as CUPS+IO. Please rename this constant to CUPSIOError.\n\n    Words in names that are initialisms or acronyms (e.g. \"URL\" or \"NATO\") have a consistent case. For example, \"URL\" should appear as \"URL\" or \"url\" (as in \"urlPony\", or \"URLPony\"), never as \"Url\". As an example: ServeHTTP not ServeHttp. For identifiers with multiple initialized \"words\", use for example \"xmlHTTPRequest\" or \"XMLHTTPRequest\".",
