      "message": "I agree. What I considered for this was creating a set of \"performance tests\" that didn\u0027t run together with regular tast tests but, say, every 1-2 weeks - as opposed to running as part of the CQ since they would potentially take hours to complete. I have no idea if scheduling these standalone, non-blocking, performance tast tests is is even feasible with out current testing infrastructure though.",
