      "message": "just to check, is this formatting intentional? it looks like sizes above 1 MiB are truncated and printed directly, but if it\u0027s less than a meg, there are 6 digits to the right of the decimal point, which is more precision than i\u0027d expect. i\u0027m not sure that the \u00278\u0027 does anything either, as i think the string is always going to be at least 8 runes wide (i.e. \"0.000000\").\n\nwould it make more sense to just use something like \".3f\" here, or maybe even add a suffix and print either e.g. \"3 MiB\" or \"125 KiB\"? see e.g. https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/src/chromiumos/cmd/tast/run/local.go#567\n\nafter writing this, i see that you already had this discussion. leaving out the units seems fine, but i\u0027d still recommend considering shortening the precision here unless you actually need it.",
