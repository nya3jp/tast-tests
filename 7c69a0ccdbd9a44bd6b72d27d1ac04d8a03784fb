That said, the media team is touching the old VDA for Linux, so this might catch regressions there earlier.\n\nOne question though: since we have eve and kevin on the Chromium CQ, does that mean that the Chrome sheriff will be in charge of reverting bad CLs? Will a bad CL still hold a Chrome uprev, though?",
