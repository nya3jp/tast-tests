This both lets developers know what’s happening when they run your test interactively and helps when looking at logs to investigate timeout failures.\n\nOn the other hand, avoid logging unnecessary information that would clutter the logs. If you want to log a verbose piece of information to help determine the cause of an error, only do it after the error has occurred.\"\n\nbasically, \"log things that may be slow\"",
