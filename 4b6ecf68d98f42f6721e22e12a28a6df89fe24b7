      "message": "Thanks for the comment. As I dug into the details, I\u0027ve got to notice that the mouse click event may have IS_DOUBLE_CLICK or IS_TRIPLE_CLICK flag, therefore it does not start the drag (https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:ash/wm/toplevel_window_event_handler.cc;l\u003d675), and it seems events within 500msecs are considered as double-click (https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:ui/events/event.cc;l\u003d531).\n\nWith that, I changed the CL; simply increasing the drag duration should fix the issue.\n\nMaybe we may want to refactor the detection of double/triple clicks in chromium code base, but I believe that would be a different topic.",
