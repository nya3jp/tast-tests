Showing and hiding quicksetting menu were confirmed to be flaky, thus it fails to open audio settings.\n\nPlus, the quicksettings.go is written using old ui library, and it is soon to be migrated to use uiauto, will stabilize it after the migration if needed.",

Since many existing tests are using quicksettings.go, it might need more efforts to ensure the compatibility.\n\nPlus, another major issue is the constants used, https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/chrome/ui/quicksettings/constants.go?q\u003dquicksettings\n\nSome contants (e.g., \"BubbleFrameView\") are also a cause of flakiness in our scenario. I was planning to stablize this part after the migration to uiauto is done (there is a TODO here).",
