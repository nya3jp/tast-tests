      "message": "I\u0027d prefer we not start using yet-another means of identifying network devices. Among other reasons, lshw does way too much and can take approximately 1 second to run. You\u0027re also prone to accidentally picking up an internal Ethernet device instead of WiFi, if it exists and happens to be enumerated first by lshw.\n\nYou\u0027re also assuming that the PCI port numbering is what the driver uses for its Linux device numbering. That\u0027s not really guaranteed.\n\nThe conventional way we\u0027ve gotten this in the past is using something like this (obviously rewritten in Go, not shell):\n\n  basename \"$(readlink -f /sys/class/net/\u003cWiFi-device-name\u003e/device)\"\n\nOne can add that to a network library somewhere, just like we already have in Autotest: client/common_lib/cros/network/interface.py, Interface.parent_device_name().\n\nYou can get the WiFi-device-name via shill.WifiInterface() or similar.",
