      "message": "The other method I tried still involved key presses, which was holding down the ctrl key, pressing minus 3 times, and releasing the ctrl key. Both that method and the one written here performed equally, so I chose this method since it was much simpler.\n\nSuch an action like this could possibly add flakiness, but I\u0027m not sure any way of directly setting browser zoom. I did run this test many, many times at this point, and I\u0027ve never seen any flakiness at least. However, to be safe, I could log the zoom error here instead of fail the test outright, since ~ 60% of the devices don\u0027t even need the browser zoom to work properly. I don\u0027t think zoom itself should affect any of the WebRTC metrics.",
