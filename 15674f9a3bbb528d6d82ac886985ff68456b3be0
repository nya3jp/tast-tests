      "message": "The issue isn\u0027t that the if line was too long; the problem is that the test failure message isn\u0027t very descriptive.\n\nInstead, you can say that you expect two tokens, or the first to be sku_number, etc.\n\nThat said, I still am not sure this is the best test approach; this command was only added for testing, and all it\u0027s checking is the format of the response.",
