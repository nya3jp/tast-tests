      "message": "The issue isn\u0027t that the if line was too long; the problem is that the test failure message isn\u0027t very descriptive.\n\nInstead, you can say that you expect two tokens, or the first to be sku_number, etc.\n\nThat said, I still am not sure this is the best test approach; this command was only added for testing, and all it\u0027s checking is the format of the response.",

      "message": "The issue here is that $SKU_NUMBER is hard to interpret in the output here.\n\nFundamentally, this test is a bit problematic because it\u0027s not providing a real expected value; it\u0027s choosing to take anything.\n\nAnyway, you can have an error that there\u0027s no sku_number entry, and a separate one that you expect to see a non-empty string value for it.",
