      "message": "\u003e There doesn\u0027t seem to be much information here but why are you moving from automation APIs to clicking through with strings?\n\nI\u0027m actually trying to use tast automation tools instead of the Oobe test API. Tast tools use a11y tree which should be closer to what user does. For example Oobe test API does not check if button is visible.\n\u003e \n\u003e One of the big problems here is these strings exist in chromium/src and the tests live in chromiumos/platform/tast-tests, if a string changes in chromium/src this has previously taken multi day multi week effort to land string changes and update the tests.\n\u003e \nGotcha, is there a good practive to mitigate these issues? I guess we could provide the names through the test api and then use them for the nodewith... calls. That way strings might be easily updated. WDYT?\n\n\u003e If there\u0027s a broader reason why (or even a bug) can you list that here?",
