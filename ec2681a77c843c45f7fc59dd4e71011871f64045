      "message": "Sure, I currently have two use cases in mind, but there are definitely many more:\n\n1. Some Agile Multiband certification tests require having e.g. 6 SSIDs, and we currently don\u0027t have a way to do that.\n2. We currently limit scan SSIDs to 3 (b/172212323), and since we can only have a maximum of 2 in our tests, we never exercise this limit. That being said, I currently don\u0027t have an option for hidden SSID, so I\u0027ll probably just add that as well while I\u0027m here anyway.",
