      "message": "Hi, I realised that when EnterpriseRollbackPreviousVersion runs in an unsupported board, the test fails with `Failed to reset TPM after test:...` instead of being successful. This error comes from the cleanup process, which should not be needed if the test is skipped. I have moved the check before any other step is carried out and the cleanup process is deferred so the error is avoided.",
