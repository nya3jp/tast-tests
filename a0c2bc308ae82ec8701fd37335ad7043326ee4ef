      "message": "IIUC these constants are exposed to all tests under chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/arc.

For example, I think the constants other than zipFile can be made local to some function if we pass unarchiverName to unzipFile() as an argument. Also, zipFile sounds a little too general and maybe a more specific name would be preferable.",
