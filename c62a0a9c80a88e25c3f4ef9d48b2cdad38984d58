      "message": "Hello Hashimoto-san,\n\nI double-checked, and indeed you were on the recipient list of the notifications:\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/8vYDkJwnv72YvyF\n\nThe spreadsheet might not be showing you everything because of filters applied. I just cleared out one of the filters so that they should show all aged informational tests now.\ngo/retiring-old-informational-tests-2022\n\nFor re-enabling the test(s), there are two options. \n1) If you plan on promoting the test to CQ very shortly (eg. \u003c2 months), then reenable it as an Informational test.\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_public/src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/arc/concierge_crash.go;l\u003d28\n\n2) Otherwise, move it to a custom test-suite so that it can run less frequently. If your team does not have their own test suite(s) setup, I\u0027m setting up a suite that will run tests either daily, mon/wed/fri, or weekly. You can use that as well. It\u0027s not ready yet though - ETA is roughly 1-2 weeks from now: b/244383456",
