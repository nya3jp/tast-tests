They opt into a gwsq model instead (with individual tests having a Contacts array to specify an owner or team for the test).\n\nThe only usage I\u0027ve seen for OWNERS is if a team are actively managing the content in the folder [2] [3] which I for sure know we\u0027re not doing and I imagine having any tast-owners@ reviewer look at changes be more beneficial then any cros-disks owner.\n\nWDYT?\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/g/tast-reviewers/c/4oGiPOwg_lI/m/XDn-bvm6BQAJ\n[2] https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/crostini/data/OWNERS\n[3] https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/android/OWNERS",
