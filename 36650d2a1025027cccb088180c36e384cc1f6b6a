      "message": "Please review! I wanted this CL to review my idea for how we can simulate mouse movements. Once I iron out the feedback on this CL, I can have further discussions on where else we want to add this function. A potential easy candidate would probably be ArcYoutubeCUJ, where we just passively sleep for a long time while we watch the video.",

Of course, I don\u0027t want to hurt all the test performance numbers -- I guess I didn\u0027t think moving the mouse was that performance changing.Another idea is to just increase the delta time, so we move the mouse much slower?",
