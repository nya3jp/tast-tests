Thanks!",

      "message": "Looks to me like the pattern here is an array of network configurations that we want to configure and then verify (possibly with slight modifications because of passwords etc).\n\nCan we make this explicit? E.g. have a type (with improved the naming)\n\n```\ntype struct NetworkToVerify {\n  nc.NetworkTypeConfigProperties configure\n  nc.(Managed)NetworkTypeConfigProperties verify\n}\n\nvar psk \u003d ...\n\nvar networks \u003d [] NetworkToVerify {\n  NetworkToVerify {psk, pskWithEmptyPassword},\n  NetworkToVerify {peapWifi, peapWifiWithModificationsRequired}\n}\n```\n\nyou can just use index in the array instead of the reference strings then to know which network is which. And it can be easily extended by adding more configurations.",
