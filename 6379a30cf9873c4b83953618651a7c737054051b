It think the tests failed because of a changed introduced in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3017712.\n\nThe policy ProxySettings is not working (as it used to at least). I can see on the policy page a couple of errors which don\u0027t make much sense so I think ProxySettings may be broken on Chrome OS. Do you know if we have an open bugs regarding ProxySettings?",
