In b/190654801, it said, \"We can use Ash.InteractiveWindowResize.TimeToPresent.MaxLatency to determine the smoothness.\"\n\nI don\u0027t see it was used anywhere and I don\u0027t see any code related to measuring smoothness. Is it intended? It is only a question. Nothing wrong with the code.\n\nI do have one other comment. Please take a look.\n\nThanks.\n",
