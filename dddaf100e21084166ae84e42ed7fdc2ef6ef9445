      "message": "Ideally, each subtest should take about 10-15 second to finish. Lengthening the timeout for subtest is to make sure the possibility to reach the timeout on a low-end device is low enough. Ideally, it is unexpected to consume more than 4 minutes to finish the whole test.\n\nHowever, to avoid chance failing innocent subtest due to the overall timeout, I think it would be better to lengthen the overall timeout as well.\n\nThanks for reminding. Making it to 7 minutes since the setup takes time too.",
