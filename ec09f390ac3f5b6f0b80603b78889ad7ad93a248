According to the test logs, veyron_fieval is one of such.\n\nCan you find the way to work on such situation?  Maybe you can use a mouse (ash.Mouse... functions). Or, I have pointer package which is under ui; you could move it to somewhere and use it from here (https://godoc.org/chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests.git/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/ui/pointer).  Maybe chrome/ui/pointer package might be a good location.",
