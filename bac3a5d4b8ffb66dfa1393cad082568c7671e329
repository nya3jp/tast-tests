Check the account history and only do this if it\u0027s been \u003e5 days\n2. Figure out how to tell when it\u0027s safe to re-add the account.\n\nI posted in the bug, but we\u0027re seeing failures here when there\u0027s some kind of interaction with the authentication server that\u0027s causing the LST to be revoked.
