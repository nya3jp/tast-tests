But this will require code changes in autotest as well.\n\nOn a somewhat unrelated note, I just noticed that Platform and Parent fields are nullable json fields, but Config has them defined as string not string pointer.  This means that it will be impossible to determine if one of these has been set to null or \"\" just by using Config.  I think logically we can treat these the same but still nil seems a better way of defining non-existence than empty string.",

      "message": "I think we would still need to wrap json.Unmarshal in a function. Otherwise, if json.Unmarshal returns an error, NewConfig would not be able to catch/wrap/return that error.\n\nWith that in mind, if we kept unmarshalOntoCfg but removed the error checks we would have:\n\n    unmarshalOntoCfg :\u003d func(b []byte) {\n        err \u003d json.Unmarshal(b, \u0026cfg)\n        if err !\u003d nil {\n            err \u003d errors.Wrapf(err, \"unmarshaling json bytes %s onto config %+v\", b, cfg)\n        }\n    }\n\nThis could also mask errors. Consider the following circumstance:\n\n1. We load the Coral config with no error. We defer unmarshalOntoCfg(coralBytes).\n2. We load the Reef (coral\u0027s parent) config. An error occurs during parentFromBytes, and we return a descriptive error.\n3. The deferred unmarshalOntoCfg(coralBytes) runs. In the first line, `err \u003d json.Unmarshal(b, \u0026cfg)`, err is set to nil.\n4. The defer stack completed, NewConfig returns with err \u003d\u003d nil, despite that an error occurred.",

We could optionally replace the `%d` interpolations with `1` directly, but that defeats the point of having the defaultValue constant.\n\nWe could also have a function to create new a new []byte based on a list of field names.
