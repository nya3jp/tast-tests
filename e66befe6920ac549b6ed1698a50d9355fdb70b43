      "message": "It looks like the operations added here can pretty much all be done through command line, thus I would recommend that AuthSession kiosk mount be done through the tast/common/hwsec/cryptohome_client.go library instead of tast/local/cryptohome library. This is so that we\u0027ll have more flexibility to test AuthSession kiosk mount in both local and remote test in the future.\n\nHowever, I understand that there are some existing code in this library that you might need to properly test AuthSession kiosk mount and it may be too expensive to go with tast/common in this CL, so I think it\u0027s fine to leave this as is and move to tast/common later.",
