      "message": "+aashay\n\nI see, yes, it looks like we do not have any vell devices in the lab at the moment. We could do one of the following:\n\n[1] enable fuzzing on just vell devices after they are deployed in the lab\n[2] OR; use this CL for the time-being for fuzzing redrix devices with the modem. This means that using the hwdep.D() check alone would not be sufficient(and we would need to do something like checking for \"/sys/kernel/debug/ccci_driver/flashing\" on the DUT.) Is this fine seewaifu@?",
