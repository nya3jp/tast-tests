This is mostly because I wanted this method to manually navigate to the network rather than relying on opening the Settings at a specific page/url since users likely won\u0027t do this much.\n\nI don\u0027t really feel strongly here though so I can update it if this is the preferred approach.\n\n\nAlso, I added a note to the commit message but one thing I meant to call out was that this change also puts the burden on the test author to make sure the technology is enabled (or else you can\u0027t navigate to the detailed page).",

      "message": "I guess it would probably not be easy to check if the technology is enabled and just throw an error from inside OpenNetworkDetailPage, right? Might at least be worth it to put something in the error message that whoever is running the test should check if the technology is enabled if we get that failure (on L359 or L363?).\n\nSeems like the added complexity probably isn\u0027t worth keeping the API the same on this one.
