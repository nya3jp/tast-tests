      "message": "This makes me a bit nervous: the test seems to consist of multiple phases, and each phase calls MountVault and then Unmount/Remove should be done as the cleanup. I guess it comes to an unexpected state if the test fails at a preparation of the next state (like hwseclocal.RestartTPMDaemons() of Phase 2 below), because Unmount is already done and the next MountVault isn\u0027t called yet.\n\nConsidering that, I would like to propose as follows:\n* turn each phase as a different function: (i.e. func() { s.Log(\"Phase 1...\") ... }())\n* or use of s.Run (https://godoc.org/chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast.git/src/chromiumos/tast/testing#State.Run)\n* in each of phase, have this defer, to make sure the cleanup is done at the end of each phase",
