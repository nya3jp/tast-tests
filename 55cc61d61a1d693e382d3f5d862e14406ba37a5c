      "message": "I don\u0027t really want to have this function here. If it is used incorrectly (e.g., called from another goroutine as StopRecording), then there could be a nullpointer exception. But I need it for the unit tests of Timeline. In those tests, I am waiting for certain conditions, e.g., for the goroutine to go to sleep or for a snapshot to be taken. If an error occurs during taking a snapshot, the goroutine stops and we would be waiting forever. So there must be a way to check if we are still recording.",
