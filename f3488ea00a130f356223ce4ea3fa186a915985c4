      "message": "Thanks to Brendan\u0027s suggestion to click on label instead of text field. The flakiness is gone. I also followed Kyle\u0027s suggestion to wait for all the icons to go away when there is a change from tablet mode to clamshell mode. I think it is working.\n\nI have run the current code 3 times in both clamshell mode and tablet mode on octopus, hana, kodama and dru. They were all successfully. I am not able to test it on jax, flaffy and karma yet because I was not able to lease them. I will try later, but I think this code is good as is.\n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks.\n\nSeewai\n",
