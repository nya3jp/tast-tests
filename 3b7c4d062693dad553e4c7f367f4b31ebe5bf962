      "message": "For the reven test: this looks like Landlock is disabled there but the 5.10 check isn’t sufficient to detect that. As of this writing I’m not certain the exact version used in the test -- one possibility is it’s a version of 5.10 before Landlock was backported.\n\nGoing to see if setting the cutoff at 5.15 gets better results, in parallel with looking into the board further and seeing if I need to further adjust how the test checks for Landlock being enabled.\n",
