      "message": "Sorry for the delay, I originally expect to use the scripts of shill but it is quite unfortunate that shill-test-scripts is not installed in testbed-ap image... Releasing a new image with it might take much time and we\u0027ll need other solutions before that.\n\nTo avoid parsing the dbus-send, I\u0027m not sure if the following alternatives might be OK (both is kind of hacky...)\n\nAlternative 1:\n- Polling until link up (should be brought up by shill -\u003e shill already detect the device)\n- Device.Disable\n- Polling until link down\n- Bring link up\n\nAlternative 2:\n- Polling for a successful Device.Disable\n- Polling until link down\n- Bring link up\n\nWDYT?",
