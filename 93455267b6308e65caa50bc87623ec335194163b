Did I get this right?\n\nInterestingly, either `cr` or `br` for tracing here makes the test passed with some numbers without any error.\n+Toni, Eliot any thoughts?",

      "message": "yeah, those metrics are recorded in ash-chrome.\n\nI think that the test passes with br, and cr is because it\u0027s waiting for histograms that are colleced in perfutil.RunAndWaitAll, which does not depend on br. So I assume using br would likely not break test, but would not save the intended trace file.",
