Also, doing this in ChildWallpaperSync relies on the implementation detail that the EducoexistenceInsession test just happens to follow ChildWallpaperSync by coincidence. I suggest these other options:\n\n1) Make ChildWallpaperSync use a different fixture (instead of \"familyLinkUnicornLogin\" above). Tests that don\u0027t share the fixture won\u0027t share the same login session.\n2) Fix this ChildWallpaperSync test so that it doesn\u0027t hide the system UI at the end.",

      "message": "1) Doesn\u0027t seem like a good option because we should recycle fixtures as much as possible instead of creating a new one just for this test, and the familyLinkUnicornLogin fixture is probably the most appropriate one for this test.\n2) Seems more reasonable. If the hiding the system UI is a synced setting, can we just manually log into the test account (credentials here [1]) and turn the setting off? This would be a no-code way to fix the tests.\n\n[1] https://source.corp.google.com/chromeos_internal/src/platform/tast-tests-private/vars/family.yaml;l\u003d23?q\u003df:tast%20family.unicornEmail%20f:.yaml",
