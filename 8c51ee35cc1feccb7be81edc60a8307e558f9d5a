      "message": "tbegin@: This change is a little awkward. It will change the Vars to []string{\"router\", \"pcap\"}, which is more common for wificell tests but it will not be aligned with DiagSignalStrength.\n\nOne alternative is:\nStill create a new Fixture with only TFFeaturesRouters feature for this test to keep the Vars. Also modify Tauto wrapper to pass \"routers\" so it could properly run with suites in Tauto.\n\nWDYT?",
