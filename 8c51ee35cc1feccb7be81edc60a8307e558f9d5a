It will change the Vars to []string{\"router\", \"pcap\"}, which is more common for wificell tests but it will not be aligned with DiagSignalStrength.\n\nOne alternative is:\nStill create a new Fixture with only TFFeaturesRouters feature for this test to keep the Vars. Also modify Tauto wrapper to pass \"routers\" so it could properly run with suites in Tauto.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Sorry, I should provide more context about this.\n\n\u003e  If I understand correctly the basic wificellFixt will not provide access to the router?\n\nThey both provide access to the router. The differences between the default Fixture/Precondition and the one with \u0027TFFeaturesRouters\u0027 are:\n- The former has a single router and the latter can have multiple.\n- The former reads a router hostname from \"router\" variable and the latter reads router hostnames from \"routers\" variable. (\"pcap\" is used by both)\n\nHowever, as the test code didn\u0027t use ConfigureAPOnRouterID, I think it doesn\u0027t need TFFeaturesRouters so the only difference caused by this change is the variables.\n\nAlso, some problems with \u0027TFFeaturesRouters\u0027:\n- We don\u0027t yet have a multi-router setup. It will use router + pcap as two routers for now.\n- \"routers\" variable is not set by the current wificell wrapping in Tauto as it is not for multi-router setup. It could be a problem when the test is reached with  `test_that --args\u003d\"router_addr\u003d$ROUTER_IP pcap_addr\u003d$PCAP_IP\" $DUT_IP tast.wificell-func-unstable`",

If the vars change doesn\u0027t cause problems in your manual runs, I believe this change should be safe. Mark this comment as resolved.\n\nAs to network.DiagSignalStrength, I think currently wificell_roam is the only group that is expected to have attenuator, so it\u0027s OK to keep \"wificellFixtRoaming\" here for now (consistent with other tests in the group). We can also change it after we have more suitable group/fixture for the test.",
