It will change the Vars to []string{\"router\", \"pcap\"}, which is more common for wificell tests but it will not be aligned with DiagSignalStrength.\n\nOne alternative is:\nStill create a new Fixture with only TFFeaturesRouters feature for this test to keep the Vars. Also modify Tauto wrapper to pass \"routers\" so it could properly run with suites in Tauto.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Sorry, I should provide more context about this.\n\n\u003e  If I understand correctly the basic wificellFixt will not provide access to the router?\n\nThey both provide access to the router. The differences between the default Fixture/Precondition and the one with \u0027TFFeaturesRouters\u0027 are:\n- The former has a single router and the latter can have multiple.\n- The former reads a router hostname from \"router\" variable and the latter reads router hostnames from \"routers\" variable. (\"pcap\" is used by both)\n\nHowever, as the test code didn\u0027t use ConfigureAPOnRouterID, I think it doesn\u0027t need TFFeaturesRouters so the only difference caused by this change is the variables.\n\nAlso, some problems with \u0027TFFeaturesRouters\u0027:\n- We don\u0027t yet have a multi-router setup. It will use router + pcap as two routers for now.\n- \"routers\" variable is not set by the current wificell wrapping in Tauto as it is not for multi-router setup. It could be a problem when the test is reached with  `test_that --args\u003d\"router_addr\u003d$ROUTER_IP pcap_addr\u003d$PCAP_IP\" $DUT_IP tast.wificell-func-unstable`",
