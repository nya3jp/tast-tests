      "message": "no, this was a deliberate design decision to make it easier to see what a test is doing (i.e. everything is in a single file; if it depends on code somewhere else, you can see the import). https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/docs/design_principles.md#the-test-system-should-have-opinions-about-the-right-way-to-write-tests touches on this briefly, and there\u0027s a bit more on the mailing list at https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/tast-users/yxXVl-axeQk/discussion.\n\nif you think we\u0027re likely to need to run memtester with different parameters in different tests, i\u0027ll move the logic into a subpackage that can be shared so that this test essentially becomes a one-liner.",
