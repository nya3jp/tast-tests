      "message": "Hi Matthew, the issue here isn\u0027t that DFS channels are used. It\u0027s that given the regulatory setting, the channel used (which isn\u0027t DFS), is considered a no IR channel (cannot radiate first). \n\nIf we were to consider the union of the 2 zones (US and 00), we would only have 4 possible channels to transmit on: \n\n                        * 5180 MHz [36] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5200 MHz [40] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5220 MHz [44] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5240 MHz [48] (23.0 dBm)\nThe other other channels are either at least no IR (perhaps also DFS channels) or disabled entirely at least on openwrt.\n\nWhen we look at gales, having DFS-UNSET doesn\u0027t have this limitation where most channels can\u0027t be transmitted on:\n\n                        * 5180 MHz [36] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5200 MHz [40] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5220 MHz [44] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5240 MHz [48] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5260 MHz [52] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5280 MHz [56] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5300 MHz [60] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5320 MHz [64] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5500 MHz [100] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5520 MHz [104] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5540 MHz [108] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5560 MHz [112] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5580 MHz [116] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5600 MHz [120] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5620 MHz [124] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5640 MHz [128] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5660 MHz [132] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5680 MHz [136] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5700 MHz [140] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5720 MHz [144] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5745 MHz [149] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5765 MHz [153] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5785 MHz [157] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5805 MHz [161] (23.0 dBm)\n                        * 5825 MHz [165] (23.0 dBm)\n                        \nThese channels are all allowed on gale.",
