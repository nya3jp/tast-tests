We have to check the debugging port in the file is for the current running Lacros, rather than the one which was terminated.\n",

      "message": "Hmm, I\u0027m not sure I understand the problem correctly. IIUC test scenarios need to be aware of lacros-chrome\u0027s behavior that it will exit on all windows closed? Then we might want to ask tests to call a certain function to let the library know that all windows are closed, with which we can deal with restart races. Maybe I\u0027m missing something.",
