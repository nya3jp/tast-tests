We could probably parse with a regexp, but I don\u0027t know how much that buys us - since we don\u0027t know the expected number of lines beforehand, we\u0027d need one regex for the header keys and then we\u0027d need to loop through each of the other lines of output and hit them with a second regex. Without the regex, we get a more descriptive message saying exactly which metric failed, but there\u0027s definitely more code involved. Any preferences?",
