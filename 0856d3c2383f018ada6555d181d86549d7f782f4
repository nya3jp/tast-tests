      "message": "Dealing with older branches in the ToT code is concerned approach, IMO, as we don\u0027t have such use cases in general.\n\nFirst of all, could you describe why you need to run tests with older branches, like m90, even if it is known to fail? What\u0027s the benefit/value that failure produces? Why it is necessary to maintain in ToT while there\u0027s no continuous ways to run it against older branches (AFAIK)?",

In m90, resourced did not exist, so the metrics that are resulted by this function did not exist, either.\nAs for \"we should not be initializing\"  - this is exactly what this code does.. it bypasses execution very early, when we detect that resourced is not available.",

The tast tests is tied to the current version of chrome os. And, that\u0027s why we make branches of tast tests together with OS releases.\n\nIf you need to run it for some reasons manually one time even if it is known to fail, i wouldn\u0027t block you of course, but making some changes to deal with such an exceptional cases sounds like a worried piece from over-all maintenance perspective.",
