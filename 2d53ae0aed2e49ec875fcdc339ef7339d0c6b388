      "message": "I have renamed the external apk data file to reflect the CTS version (9.0) and revision (r9). I think that\u0027s enough to keep track of what version/revision we are on instead of hardcoding it in the code. As far as I understand for .apk files it doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s linux x86 or arm or whatnot since they all get pushed to the Android device (not 100% sure about arm vs x86 though, but it should be Java runtime anyway)",
