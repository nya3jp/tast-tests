      "message": "I wonder if we have a race condition here. e.g. the following order:\n1. shill: interface gone. remove the device and send PropertyChanged.\n2. shill: interface is back. add back the device. (and send PropertyChanged)\n3. tast: captured the signal from step 1.\n4. tast: list devices and get interface name.\n(Once step 4 is executed after step 2, we cannot detect the removal.)\n\nI think there\u0027s a similar case in iwlwifi rescan test where the value of pw.WaitAll is used instead of another GetProperties. As there should be a signal where the interface is removed, we will definitely see the interface gone when traversing that list of ObjectPaths.",
