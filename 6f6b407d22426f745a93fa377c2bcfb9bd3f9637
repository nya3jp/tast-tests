      "message": "This is debug version of the LoginPerf tast test.\nIt has a few issues:\n- Open windows are not saved across logout/login. I don\u0027t know why.\n- It some times time out waiting for some metric, which is very strange. I added debug to Chrome and it seems to always generate relevant metrics.\n- It does not support lacros, as its bindings seem to require login through the fixtures (i.e. it does not seem possible to log in / log out withing the test function).\n\n\nPTAL.\n\nWDYT?",
