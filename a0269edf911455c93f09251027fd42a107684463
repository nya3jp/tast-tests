      "message": "I see that this CL increases the test timeouts by 20 seconds, apparently because `WaitForOwnership` \"waits for up to 20 seconds\" according to [1]. I suggest making that 20 seconds a constant with a name ending in `Timeout`, consistent with other constants already used to express those test timeouts. Also use the new constant at [2], and update the comment at [1] to refer to the constant instead of saying \"20 seconds.\"\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/login/userutil/user_util.go;drc\u003d692e1a260a6e39f569f0a02f0ad9780ec51cf5ad;l\u003d74\n[2] https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/src/chromiumos/tast/local/bundles/cros/login/userutil/user_util.go;drc\u003d692e1a260a6e39f569f0a02f0ad9780ec51cf5ad;l\u003d84",

      "message": "I think adding exported value would be fair, but simultaneously, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary to add exact 20 seconds to the test timeout.\nIt is because WaitForOwnership uses it as a timeout, which I think just to ensure the program doesn\u0027t hang indefinitely, and usually takes only few seconds.",
