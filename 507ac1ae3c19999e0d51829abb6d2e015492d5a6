      "message": "Hi Ross. These tests have not run on M87 since this CL was merged. This CL was merged in 13520; your screenshot\u0027s most recent M87 version was 13505.\n\nYour screenshot does show some more recent runs in R88-13550. That\u0027s because of another recent CL that merged last night: https://crrev.com/c/2492889. I reactivated the \"normal\" subset of firmware.BootMode tests, because they were not the source of the issues that led us to deactivate the tests. This will allow us to start stabilizing the library.\n\nAs far as I know, Tast tests are not branched, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary to cherry-pick this CL into M87.\n\nDoes that clear things up?",

      "message": "The Tast tests are branched along with the rest of the codebase for each release branch.  These tests were disabled in R88-13520.0.0, but R87 branched back in R87-13505.0.0 and we\u0027ve been creating a testing new builds from that branch each day since then.  You can probably see this most clearly by looking at Goldeneye:\n\nhttp://go/goldeney\n\nhttp://screen/B8YpiJpUQB7zfVa\n\nR87-13505.21.0, the latest M87 build, was built yesterday and these tests have generated 1,805 failures when run against that one build:\n\nhttp://screen/B2NztAhKVsf3Tx9\n\nThe solution is to cherry pick the CL which disables these tests back the R87 branch.  We are still early enough in the M87 release cycle (first few weeks of beta) that for this type of change you can self-approve your merge.
