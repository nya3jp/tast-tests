      "message": "@yawano@google.com Hi Yuki, could you PLAT again? Thanks!\n\nI try to replicate this bug in the chromium side but failed: the avatar could always be clicked and selected. This confirms that it is a UI sync issue from the tast-test side rather than the product side.\n\nI tried to run this test for 20+ times in D/L mode, different boards and models, etc., none of which failed to select back the default avatar.\n\nObserving the screenshots, I realized that all the failure cases are triggered in light mode, so I enforce this test to run in light mode, wishing that it could fix the issue temporarily.",

      "message": "Thank you for trying to reproduce this issue!\n\nMy concern of this type of change is that this can hide a real problem/regression. For example, we might introduce a regression later that clicking the profile button fails to change the icon back to the profile image for 100% of the time. The retry logic will hide the regression.",
