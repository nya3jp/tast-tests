      "message": "@yawano@google.com Hi Yuki, could you PLAT again? Thanks!\n\nI try to replicate this bug in the chromium side but failed: the avatar could always be clicked and selected. This confirms that it is a UI sync issue from the tast-test side rather than the product side.\n\nI tried to run this test for 20+ times in D/L mode, different boards and models, etc., none of which failed to select back the default avatar.\n\nObserving the screenshots, I realized that all the failure cases are triggered in light mode, so I enforce this test to run in light mode, wishing that it could fix the issue temporarily.",
