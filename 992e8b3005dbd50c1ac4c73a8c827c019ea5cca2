What\u0027s the contract here? Is someone else clearing out object IDs before we get to the WiFi tests? If not, what happens if I run 2 tests in a row in separate \u0027tast\u0027 invocations? They\u0027ll both use 8800 -- is that good or bad?\n\nI see there\u0027s a previous comment thread about what the legal values are. Those aren\u0027t documented anywhere, AFAICT.",
